November 25, 2016, 2:30 p.m.   3:30 p.m. Synthetic photochemistry has experienced a tremendous resurgence in interest. Photochemistry is viewed as a  green  strategy for organic synthesis, and new developments in photocatalysis employing visible light, as well as enabling technologies like continuous flow techniques, have all likely contributed to renewed interest in exploited photochemical activation as a tool in synthesis. The development of new Cu-based heteroleptic photocatalysts, their uses in synthesis and comparison with existing UV light-mediated reactions will be discussed. Shawn K. Collins was born in 1974 and raised in Val d'Or, Qu bec. He obtained a B.Sc. (Honours) degree from Concordia University in 1996 while working with Professor Ozzie S. Tee. He completed his doctoral dissertation in 2001 with Professor Alex G. Fallis at the University of Ottawa. After an NSERC postdoctoral fellowship with Professor Larry E. Overman (University of California, Irvine), he joined the faculty at Universit  de Montr al in September 2003 as an Assistant Professor. He was promoted to the rank of Associate Professor in 2009 and to Full Professor in 2015.

Which is where these two Concordia graduate students come in... Maniya Aghasibeig is a PhD candidate with the Electro-Catalytic Green Engineering Group  and the  Thermal Spray Laboratory in the  Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering . Cindy Buonomano is a PhD student in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry  and president of the Chemistry and Biochemistry Graduate Student Association.   Why did you become a scientist or an engineer? Cindy Buonomano:  Ever since I was a little girl, I've known I wanted to be a scientist. I read scientific magazines, watched scientific TV shows and made my own observations from scientific experiments. Cindy Buonomano Naturally, in school, I oriented my education towards science and, more specifically, chemistry. I was interested in finding out how everything works on a molecular level. Chemistry has brought many great moments of joy to my life. In high school, I was able to travel to Paris for a contest when I was only 17 years old. And now, here I am in Quebec to realize my dreams and maybe become a professor who can inspire other young scientists. Maniya Aghasibeig: I became fascinated with materials science after I took a high school course on the subject, and got familiar with various types of materials (metals, ceramics, polymers etc.) with different structures and properties. A year later, just prior to choosing an undergraduate major, I met someone who studied in the field, and he explained to me about its diversity and its flexibility: it can be used in many different technologies, from aerospace to health care. That was when I knew that I wanted to study in this field. Usually when I first contact people by email and introduce myself as a PhD candidate who studies mechanical engineering, they assume that I am a guy. Later, when we meet in person or speak on the phone, they are very surprised to see/hear a girl! Tell us about what you're researching now, and why. CB: I am currently a PhD student in organic chemistry. I decided to take the PhD path because I want to be a professor. In the last few years, while supervising undergraduate students, I discovered a true passion for teaching. In organic chemistry, our goal is to build drugs or molecules with a potential material application. To do it, we have to develop new methods to synthesize these interesting molecules. My research project is \"Synthesis of Heteroaromatic Compounds via Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling and Directed Ortho-Metalation Reactions.\" Maniya Aghasibeig MA: I work on manufacturing nickel electrodes using different thermal spraying techniques for hydrogen production by water electrolysis. This hydrogen can be stored, converted and used later   for instance, for electricity production with no emissions other than water vapour. The need for green and renewable energy resources arises from increasing concerns about the depletion of fossil fuels, in addition to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming that occur alongside the fast development of modern industries. These manufactured electrodes are expected to increase the efficiency of the water electrolysis process by increasing the rate of hydrogen production and lowering the process costs.  Were you inspired by other women in your field? MA: My mentor was my boss from my last industrial job: Barbara Maroli at H gan s AB in Sweden. She was extremely knowledgeable, determined and successful in her career. She became my role model the first day I met her. When I told her that I wanted to study for a PhD she was truly encouraging and supportive. She helped me to explore my options and make a decision with confidence. CB: Many women inspired me, like  Marie Curie , who got the Nobel Prize in chemistry and in physics, and  Valentina Tereshkova , the first woman to go to space. I told my little self that if these women were able to go that far, why can't I? I've had so many people in my life tell me that I would not succeed in my studies and I should stop. I am glad I never listened to them! It is hard to be a woman in a world dominated by male scientists, but trust me: you are as good as them. So be strong, and inspire other little girls to do the same. Find out how to study  mechanical and industrial engineering  or  chemistry and biochemistry  at Concordia.

Herein, we report the anionic polymerization of allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) on methoxy-PEG (mPEG) as macroinitiator to produce the diblock copolymer mPEG-b-PAGE. The mPEG-b-PAGE copolymer was then used as a common precursor to generate a systematic series of copolymers derivatized with pendant alkyl chains via thiolene click chemistry. These amphiphilic block copolymers were found to self-assemble in aqueous solution to form aggregates with distinct and unique morphologies. Depending on the hydrophobic weight fraction of the copolymer, spheres, long filomicelles, rods, disks and polymersomes with confirmed biocompatibility were formed. These materials were evaluated in terms of ability to solubilize the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). For each copolymer, stable micelle formulations were prepared that included high DOX to copolymer ratios of up to 20 % (wt%) with drug loading efficiencies > 60 % (w/w). In vitro drug release studies, conducted under physiologically relevant conditions, revealed sustained release profiles. Assessment of cytotoxicity in OVCAR8 human ovarian cancer cells grown in monolayers and spheroids confirmed that the activity of the formulated drug was conserved. The promising preliminary assessment of these alkylated copolymers encourages additional evaluation in vivo. Dr. Le D v dec carried out his undergraduate degree in biochemistry at UQAM. Under the supervision of Prof. M.A Mateescu, he completed his MSc in biochemistry in 2008 (with Honors). His work focused on the development of chromatographic devices for the separation of chitosan oligomers and the synthesis of polyalkylated chitosan for oral delivery. In 2008, he carried out his PhD, under the supervision of Prof. Julian Zhu at the University of Montreal, where he developed his skills in polymer chemistry and novel polymer drug delivery systems. After a brief time in the pharmaceutical industry, he moved to Ontario where he is currently carrying out his postdoctoral research in the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto, with Christine Allen. His research interests focus on the development and characterization of copolymers for sustained release of hydrophobic drugs from nano-scale delivery system to implantable devices, as well as the study of drug-polymer compatibility and the tunable morphology of drug carrier.

From astronomy to culinary chemistry, these educational offerings will whet your appetite Posted on September 20, 2016 | By: Meagan Boisse  Did you enjoy The Martian? If so, we may have a course for you.  | Image: Twentieth Century Fox In celebration of Science Literacy Week (Sept. 19-25), the Concordia news desk is highlighting a related activity every day. See Monday's Wiki for women in STEM!  and Wednesday's  Rocketry and robotics at Space Concordia . So you re not a scientist. But like anyone with an inquisitive mind, you still grapple with life s existential questions: Who are you? What are you? Where did you come from? How close to reality is Jurassic Park? Good news! You don t need be an expert to explore the realms of science and space. Concordia offers a myriad of courses that address some of these fundamental queries while exploring a range of subjects, from the vast expanses of the universe to the tiniest life-giving particles.   General Biology  Do you want to know why you need to eat food and breathe oxygen? The difference between science and pseudoscience? Or what your ancient ancestors looked like? Then General Biology is for you,  says Madoka Gray-Mitsumune , who teaches BIOL 202: General Biology. The course covers the fundamentals of biology and the chemistry of life. Learn about the structure and functions of cells and tissues, as well as aspects of anatomy, physiology, taxonomy, heredity and evolution.  It s designed for non-scientists who are still curious about life. Through it you will learn the makings of life using everyday examples,  says Gray-Mitsumune.   Fundamental Nutrition Where does cooking and science collide? In BIOL 203: Fundamental Nutrition, of course, where you ll take a hands-on approach to food composition.  Cooking teaches us food chemistry. Thankfully, every home still comes equipped with a kitchen,  says instructor Catherine Calogeropoulos , who teaches her students the science of nutrition through an array of culinary experiments. Can you use milk in a sauce recipe that calls for cream? Probably not, says Calogeropoulos. Relative to milk, cream contains a lot less protein. Under high heat, milk can cause the sauce to curdle   and make you look like a foolish foodie.  Science reveals itself magically before our eyes in the kitchen. By perusing the molecular gastronomy literature I ve found perfect cooking examples to anchor nearly all the scientific concepts that might elude my students and senior auditors,  she says.   Fundamentals of Health and Physical Activity This course touches upon a range of topics: cardiovascular and muscular fitness, flexibility, weight management, nutrition, disease prevention and even stress management.  Students will gain both knowledge and tools to maximize their health and energy, immediately and in the long term,  says instructor Leslie Barker, who teaches EXCI 251: Fundamentals of Health and Physical Activity.  Many students comment that EXCI 251 helped them improve their own negative eating, smoking, stress and inactivity habits, while they also learned to differentiate between scientific facts and marketing hype,  adds Barker.   Forensic Analysis Everyone knows that DNA analysis revolutionized forensics, but how? If you want to find out,  Cameron Skinner , associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, suggests you take CHEM 298 AA.  Our approach is to first learn the underlying principles by starting with the basics such as molecules, chemical reactions and so on, before working our way towards the sophisticated tools used in a modern forensics lab,  says Skinner.  You will finish the course with a more realistic understanding of the field of forensics. You'll also understand the capacities and limitations of modern analysis. Some of the lessons will be case studies, some will be drawn from the textbook ... and there will be an occasional poisoning and/or murder.  Please note: Skinner says he will not take responsibility for any damages or strife caused when you begin yelling at your TV during crime shows such as CSI.   Discovering Biotechnology  Did you enjoy The Martian?  Were you thrilled by Jurassic Park?  Did Gattaca give you pause for thought? If so, we may have a course for you,  says Paul Joyce , a professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Concordia. CHEM 209: Discovering Biotechnology begins with an exploration of the roles that genes and proteins play in life processes. It then examines the basic principles behind the manipulation of biological molecules to produce desired changes. The course also explores the ethical ramifications of such actions.  Would you like to know how close we are to establishing a base on Mars? Or if we can really clone dinosaurs (or people, for that matter)? Or how close we are to the spectre of genetic discrimination?  asks Joyce.  Then register for this course.    Introduction to Astronomy Black holes, constellations, the Milky Way galaxy and beyond   PHYS 284: Introduction to Astronomy is the course for anyone interested in space.  Students will be introduced to advanced topics from cosmology, including the Big Bang theory, as well as the study of extra-solar planets and the search for extraterrestrial life,  says Mario D Amico from Concordia s Department of Physics. PHYS 284 will be offered as an online course this winter session. Browse through multimedia components and narrated lectures on major topics in astronomy, from the comfort of your own couch.  Students will have the flexibility of taking the course using their computers. They will therefore not be required to travel, or even be located in Montreal,  adds D'Amico.

With governments like Quebec s looking to  ban organic waste  from landfills by 2020, we need to act fast to reduce the amount of food scraps we re throwing out.  A study recently published in  Waste Management  by researchers from Concordia s Faculty of Arts and Science  shows that one method of composting could yield high quality compost and high value by-products. The catch? There are worms involved.  The study s lead author, Louise H nault-Ethier, carried out her research while pursuing a master s from what is now Concordia s Individualized program. She experimented with different methods of vermicomposting to see whether they could sufficiently inactivate certain bacteria for safe public use of the compost.   Centralized composting, which is one of the fastest growing industrial composting methods, has strict governmental guidelines, requiring thermal sanitation to prevent the survival of harmful bacteria,  she says. The guidelines require that the compost reaches and maintains a heat of 55 degrees Celsius over a period of three days in a self-heating process driven by decomposer microorganisms found in the compost.   But in our case, worms graze on the decomposer community, preventing the onset of high temperatures. We wanted to see if vermicomposting, which proceeds at room temperature could still get rid of harmful bacteria.  H nault-Ethier worked with Concordia chemistry professor Yves G linas and biology professor  Vincent Martin to examine the impact of vermicomposting on E. coli, a bacteria often found in fecal matter that can easily make its way into organic waste set to be composted.  They devised three experiments to monitor the presence of E. coli, testing whether the size of the batch of compost, the amount of naturally occurring compost microbes and the rate at which the compost was fed would affect the survival of the pathogen.  Time and again, the worms worked their magic and eventually produced compost that respected the regulatory bacterial count limits. When the normal compost microbes or worms were present, E. coli declined more rapidly. Without worms or with sterile compost, it took a little more time to get there.   \"We found that the compost batches take on average 18 to 21 days to decrease the E. coli to levels well below the legal limit,  explains G linas, who worked closely with H nault-Ethier to examine how the chemicals, such as Carbon, Nitrogen or sugars, present in the compost materials would affect the bacteria s survival.  While that's slower than traditional composting methods, it s not a prohibitive amount of time.\"  Upcycling waste  For H nault-Ethier, who was recently named head of scientific projects for the David Suzuki Foundation , it s the added benefits of vermicomposting that are most important, beyond the results of the E. coli survival experiments. \"The compost it produces may lead to higher plant yields when used as a fertilizer, and   even more surprising  the red wigglers themselves could then be reused as feed for other animals on the food chain,  she says. This is what's called  upcycling    generating something more valuable than the initial waste product. Although the idea of using invertebrates as animal feed may seem a little strange, it s actually a proven method for potentially replacing the resource-intensive soybeans or fish meal traditionally used.  \"This study suggests that upcycling technologies like vermicomposting can be more widely developed for commercial use,  says H nault-Ethier. As a past environmental coordinator for Concordia, she spearheaded a large-scale worm-farming project in which 15 tons of the university s waste were composted per year.  Though traditional compost can rapidly kill potential pathogens through heat, industrial composting may actually take longer to reach maturity than vermicomposting. Why not wait a little longer to see pathogen declines in vermicomposting and then create a product that provides nutrient-rich feed to both plants and animals? It's a win-win situation.\" The results show that vermicomposting is a promising method in the sanitation of organic waste, which would allow for producing proteins for animal feed. That said, while the E. coli inactivation observed in the current study is promising, H nault-Ethier cautions that further research on a more diverse array of pathogens is still required.

Traditionally Canadian universities required an Honours degree to qualify for admission to a graduate program. In Quebec both the Specialization and the Honours program are accepted as entrance requirements. The difference between the Honours program and the Specialization program is the higher performance level demanded in the Honours program (See Undergraduate Calendar Section 31.003) and the inclusion of the Research Project and Thesis (CHEM 450), which requires independent research work of the student and an oral defence of the thesis before the Department. The Specialization in the chemistry program has the Independent Study and Practicum (CHEM 419), where the student carries out independent study and practical work under the direction of a faculty member.

The high degree of selectivity of 5-HEDH suggested that 5-oxo-ETE might play an important pathophysiological role so we investigated its effects on various types of inflammatory cells and found that, among lipid mediators, it is the most powerful chemoattractant for human eosinophils. 5-HEDH is found in most types of inflammatory cells as well as various structural cells, and its activity is limited by the availability of the cofactor NADP+. Intradermal injection of 5-oxo-ETE in humans results in eosinophil infiltration into the skin, suggesting that it may be an important mediator in asthma and other diseases characterized by tissue eosinophilia. For this reason, in collaboration with Joshua Rokach (Florida Institute of Technology) we developed antagonists targeting the OXE receptor, which mediates the actions of 5-oxo-ETE, by adding substituents mimicking the a- and w- portions of 5-oxo-ETE to an indole scaffold. Screening of these compounds resulted in the identification of chiral compounds with IC50 values in low picomolar range and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, which we are currently testing in models of skin and airway inflammation in monkeys. Such antagonists may prove to be useful therapeutic agents for treating asthma in humans. William Powell is a Professor in the Dept of Medicine at McGill University and is Associate Director of the Meakins-Christie Laboratories, which focuses on lung disease. After completing a PhD in organic chemistry at Dalhousie University he was introduced to the area of eicosanoids during a postdoctoral fellowship at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. His main research interests are in the role of eicosanoids in inflammation, in particular mediators that can induce eosinophil infiltration. He codiscovered the DP2 receptor, a second receptor for prostaglandin D2 that is highly expressed on eosinophils and promotes the migration of these cells into tissues. He also discovered a pathway resulting in the formation of the 5-lipoxygenase product 5-oxo-ETE and showed that this compound is a highly potent eosinophils chemoattractant.

Abstract The enzyme tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is of central importance in eukaryotic cells since it is required in multiple intracellular locations (nucleus, cytosol, mitochondria and plastids) for the production of mature tRNAs needed for protein synthesis. Therefore, tRNA nucleotidyltransferase serves as an excellent model protein to explore the complex roles that localization, activity, structure and stability play in defining protein function. I investigated how changes in the amino acid sequence of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase affect its structure, stability, activity and localization and may be linked, ultimately, to human disease. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism, I was the first to show that amino acid substitutions located within a region of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase required for enzyme activity, but outside of the enzyme s classical amino-terminal organellar targeting sequence, affect localization to plastids and mitochondria. These studies suggest a direct link between intracellular distribution and how tightly the protein has folded. Moreover, these data indicate that the same seven amino acid changes that result in altered stability also reduce tRNA binding and enzyme activity. To more clearly define the role that these amino acids have in enzyme structure and function and to determine whether changes in protein stability, substrate binding, or structure bring about altered localization, I have fine-structure mapped the region encompassing residues 399-420 and shown that a single amino acid substitution (K418E) can dramatically alter tRNA binding and enzyme activity without detectable effects on enzyme structure. Localization studies are now underway to determine whether the K418E substitution, or other single substitutions within this region, alters the intracellular localization of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. Using a second model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, I have further explored the link between stability and activity in protein function. I showed that a single amino acid substitution (E189F) resulted both in a 5 C decrease in thermal stability and 25-fold decrease in enzyme activity and caused a temperature-sensitive phenotype. Moreover, converting arginine 64 to tryptophan in the variant enzyme restored enzyme activity and suppressed the temperature-sensitive phenotype, but did not restore thermal stability. These data suggest that the temperature-sensitive phenotype is defined by the reduction in activity and not thermal stability. Moreover, these data were the first to suggest a role for conserved motif C in active site organization and tRNA nucleotidyltransferase function. Finally, I applied the techniques and insight acquired from my studies of the Arabidopsis and yeast enzymes to explore how seven distinct amino-acid substitutions in human tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, all previously identified in patients suffering from sideroblastic anemia with B cell immunodeficiency, periodic fevers and development delay (SIFD), affect enzyme structure, stability and function in vitro. I showed that each of these mutations affects some combination of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase structure, activity, or stability. As expected, substitutions (T154I, M158V, L166S, R190I and I223T) within the conserved catalytic amino terminal region of the protein altered stability and/or activity but more interestingly two substitutions (I326T and K416E) in the less well conserved carboxy-terminal region of the enzyme altered catalytic efficiency, tRNA binding and quaternary structure. These studies have shown that a protein s function can be defined by a combination of some or all of its structure, stability, activity or localization. Where Room SP-265.29, Richard J.

Even more remarkably, certain disordered proteins such as elastin have the capacity to self-assemble and separate into a liquid phase. In the aggregated state, elastin fulfills a vital role by imparting extensibility, elastic recoil, and resilience to diverse tissues including arterial walls, skin, lung alveoli, and the uterus. Understanding the molecular determinants of these properties has the potential to help in the rational design of useful biomimetic materials such as vascular grafts or artificial skin. Despite the biological importance of elastin and over eighty years of study, there is still no consensus model for its structure. We used massive computing to model the microscopic structure of elastin. Molecular dynamics simulations exceeding 0.2 ms afford insight into the structural ensemble of elastin-like peptides. Results demonstrate that the hydrophobic domains of elastin are structurally disordered even when assembled together, like a bag of snakes or a plate of spaghetti. Consistent with the entropic nature of elastic recoil, the aggregated state is stabilized both by the hydrophobic effect and by an increase in conformational entropy upon self-assembly. This highly-disordered state underlies the two remarkable properties of elastin, its capacity to separate into a liquid phase and to undergo elastic recoil. The structural ensemble of the elastin-like aggregate obtained here provides the first atomistic view into what may be called the liquid state of proteins.

Comparative analysis of cancer cell expression data highlights many deregulated miRNAs. Low expression of miR-125a was related to poor breast cancer prognosis. Interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in miR-125a was located within a minor allele expressed by breast cancer patients. The SNP is not predicted to affect the ground state structure of the primary transcript or precursor, but neither the precursor nor mature product is detected by RT-qPCR. How this SNP modulates the maturation of miR-125a is poorly understood. Here, building upon a model of RNA dynamics derived from nuclear magnetic resonance studies, we developed a quantitative model enabling the visualization and comparison of networks of transient structures. We observed a high correlation between the distances between networks of variants with that of their respective wild types and their relative degrees of maturation to the latter, suggesting an important role of transient structures in miRNA homeostasis. We classified the human miRNAs according to pairwise distances between their networks of transient structures.

Gillies (Western) May 19, 2016, 11 a.m.   12 p.m. Self-immolative polymers are a class of materials that degrade by an end-to-end depolymerization mechanism in response to a stimulus-mediated cleavage of a stabilizing end-cap from the polymer terminus. Relative to conventional stimuli-responsive or biodegradable polymers, they exhibit several unique properties including a degradation time dependent on the degree of polymerization and the ability to change their responsiveness to stimuli by simply changing the end-cap. These aspects make them of increasing interest for a wide variety of applications including sensors, membranes, and controlled drug release. This presentation will describe our group s progress toward the development of new self-immolative polymer backbones, end-caps and block copolymers. In particular the development of new monomers capable of undergoing cyclization at different rates can enable the rate of depolymerization to be controlled. Polyglyoxylates are also particularly attractive as they can be derived from natural sources and depolymerize to metabolic intermediates. Different end-caps allow the depolymerization to be triggered under a range of different stimuli including changes in pH, reduction potential, and photochemical stimuli. Finally, the development of self-immolative block copolymers enables the controlled assembly of nanomaterials ranging from micelles to vesicles in solution. These systems enable the encapsulation and controlled release of payloads such as anti-cancer drugs.

Chorismate mutase (CM) catalyzes the rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate, which can be either converted to hydroxyphenylpyruvate by prephenate dehydrogenase (PD) or to phenylpyruvate by prephenate dehydratase (PDT). This work reports the first characterization of trifunctional PD-CM-PDT from the smallest hyperthermophilc archaeon Nanoarchaeum equitans and bifunctional CM-PD from its host, the crenarchaeon Ignicoccus hospitalis. Hexa histidine-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and chromatographed on Ni-NTA affinity resin. Both enzymes were highly thermally stable and exhibited maximal activity at 90 C. CM, PD and PDT activities were detected at temperatures consistent with enzymes from extreme thermophiles. Kinetic analysis revealed that unlike most PDs, the two archaeal enzymes were insensitive to regulation by L-Tyr and preferred NADP+ to NAD+ as a cofactor in the dehydrogenase reaction. N. equitans PDT was feedback inhibited by L-Phe (Ki = 0.8  M) in a non-competitive fashion consistent with L-Phe s combination at a site separate from that of prephenate. Gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation analysis of bifunctional CM-PD from I. hospitalis suggested that the enzyme is a native dimer. Limited proteolysis studies revealed that the enzyme is highly resistant to proteolysis but could be cleaved to yield a stable C-terminal PD domain. Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis studies confirmed that the PD domain of bifunctional I. hospitalis CM-PD could be independently isolated and expressed. Biochemical and biophysical characterization of this active truncated variant was performed and the results of solution studies were compared to those of the full-length protein and to information available from other PD enzymes. Guided by amino acid sequence alignment predictions and by models based on the available crystal structures of bacterial homologues, eight variants containing site-specific replacements were generated in I. hospitalis CM-PD as attempts to alter cofactor selectivity and substrate and product binding. Those variant proteins were kinetically characterized in order to help define the role of active site residues in substrate interactions. The are the first studies exploring the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway from the two archaeal organisms, which introduce efficient and stable catalysts as excellent candidates for applications in biotechnology.

Abstract A major bottleneck preventing the economically favourable production of biofuels from cellulose is the high cost of the cellulase enzymes used to convert cellulose into fermentable glucose units. One way to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of cellulose hydrolysis is to develop new cellulase systems with enhanced cellulose hydrolysis rates and efficiencies. A better understanding of the relationship between cellulose structure and cellulose hydrolysis mechanisms will facilitate the development of cellulases with sufficiently enhanced hydrolysis rates and efficiencies. To achieve this, I am pursuing the following two research objectives: (i) express a library of evolutionarily diverse endoglucanases representing each of several different glycosyl hydrolase families and tertiary structures; and; (ii) perform detailed characterizations on the enzymes to gain insight into the relationship between cellulase structure and cellulase function. For these studies, I compared the hydrolysis capabilities of my library of novel endoglucanases against Trichoderma reesei (T. reesei) cellulase system endoglucanases using the model substrate phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC), a substrate used in commercial ethanol production (pre-treated wheat straw), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), glucooligosaccharides, and various hemicellulose components found in pretreated lignocellulose feedstocks. About 100 fungal genome sequences were downloaded from public databases. From these, 23 fungal species were selected based on their ability to hydrolyze vascular plant biomass and on their evolutionary diversity. The 75 genes encoding endoglucanases selected from 23 fungal species were manually annotated, cloned and expressed using Aspergillus niger as the expression host. Congo Red indicator plate screening revealed that at least 37 of the endoglucanase genes expressed an active secreted endoglucanase (EG). Among the 37 EGs subjected to preliminary biochemical characterization, it was shown that the optimal pH and temperature of the 26 endoglucanases with the highest levels of activity ranged from pH 3.0 to pH 6.0 and from 40 C to 70 C. Based on the results of this detailed screening, 17 endoglucanases were selected for further analyses that included: assessing their thermostability, assessing their ability to hydrolyze short oligosaccharides, determining their substrate specificity and assessing their ability to enhance the saccharification of cellulosic substrates by the T. reesei cellulase system and various derivatives thereof.

While such predictions prove accurate in some cases, a growing number of structurally orthologous proteins with different roles have been reported. Functional differences among structurally orthologous transcription factors create what has been termed transcriptional rewiring. We have characterized some zinc cluster transcription factors (ZCFs) in Candida albicans (C. albicans) including Ppr1, Stb5 and Put3. We identified cases of total rewiring, partial rewiring and functional conservation (no rewiring) but with some regulatory fine-tuning between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae for the ZCFs Ppr1, Stb5 and Put3 respectively. We show that Ppr1 regulates purine catabolism in C. albicans, which is different from its role in S. cerevisiae where it regulates pyrimidine biosynthesis. We identified that Ppr1 rewired at Naumovozyma castellii in the phylogeny, and propose that Ppr1 rewiring is a result of cellular adaptations to permit growth in hypoxic conditions. In another study, we report that Stb5 has gone from regulating drug efflux pumps and glyoxylate cycle enzymes in C. albicans, to only regulating drug efflux pumps in S. cerevisiae. The glyoxylate cycle is required for C. albicans virulence, and our stb5 null mutants showed sensitivity to the echinocandin class of antifungal drugs. We therefore propose Stb5 as a potential drug target against candidiasis. Finally, we discovered that Put3 has conserved its role in regulating proline catabolism between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. However, unlike the case of S. cerevisiae where Put3 can only activate transcription of proline catabolism genes in the absence of rich nitrogen sources, there is no equivalent restriction in C. albicans where Put3 preserves its ability to activate proline degradation even in the presence of the rich nitrogen source ammonium sulfate, thus allowing for the use of proline as a carbon source. The robust ability of C. albicans to obtain nutrients from a variety of sources adds to its efficiency as a pathogen. These studies correlate transcriptional rewiring to species requirements, where different species adapt available transcription factors to meet their specific needs. Where Room SP 265.29, Richard J.

Therefore, protein-protein interactions are crucial for many essential cellular functions and are considered good targets for the development of novel therapeutics. Siderophore biosynthesis is one of the biological processes that has an absolute requirement for protein-protein interactions. Siderophores are small iron-scavenging molecules that are synthesized and secreted by iron-starved bacteria to chelate ferric iron (Fe3+) from the environment. Ferric iron, which is essential for survival and growth of most bacteria, is insoluble at neutral pH, or is bound to host iron storage proteins such as transferrin. By taking up Fe3+-siderophore complexes, such bacteria can survive and proliferate in low-iron environments. Enterobactin is a catecholate type siderophore of E. coli that is synthesized in its cytoplasm by seven enzymes, EntA-F and EntH. These sequentially-related enzymes function together to produce enterobactin, which is a cyclic trimer of 2,3-dihydroxy-N-benzoyl-L-serine. Enterobactin biosynthetic enzymes are organized in two functional modules: the DHB module (EntCBA) and the non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS) module (EntBDEF). Interactions between EntBDEF in the NRPS module have been previously reported. Our research group has since reported in vitro evidence of an interaction between EntA and EntE, the enzymes at the interface of the DHB and NRPS modules. The research presented here is focused on the identification of novel protein-protein interactions in the DHB module as well as the study of subunit orientation in the Ent complexes. The first research chapter is centered on the subunit orientation in the intracellular EntA-EntE complex. In this study Chrome Azurol S (CAS) assays and bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid (BACTH) assays were employed to study the EntA-EntE complexation in vivo. CAS assays were used to validate the functionality of EntA and EntE BACTH constructs. BACTH experiments were then performed to identify the intracellular complexation of EntA and EntE and to determine the orientation of EntA relative to EntE in the complex. BACTH results were further validated by automated docking simulations. The second research chapter focuses on the construction of two Fur-controlled bidirectional protein expression vectors. Ferric Uptake Regulator (Fur) is a protein involved in iron homeostasis in E. coli. When intracellular iron is abundant, Fur forms a complex with Fe2+. This complex binds to the Fur box and inhibits the transcription of iron responsive genes such as ent genes. The Fur box is the consensus sequence that is located near or within the promoter region of iron responsive genes. The novel expression vectors are derivatives of low copy number plasmids pACYC184 and pBR322 and contain a bidirectional promoter, FLAG or HA tags, TEV cleavage site and multiple cloning site (MCS) compatible with MCS of BACTH vectors. The third research chapter involves the identification of a novel protein-protein interaction between two enzymes in the DHB module, EntA and EntB. Furthermore, ternary complex formation between EntA, EntB and EntE was investigated in this chapter. BACTH was employed as the primary method for the detection of protein-protein interactions between EntA and EntB. Functionality of all the constructs used in the BACTH was confirmed using the CAS assay and growth studies. Automated docking simulations were also used to generate a model for an EntA-EntB-EntE ternary complex. The EntE-EntB interaction interface in the generated model was in accordance with the published crystal structure for EntE-EntB complex and therefore supported our experimental results.

It is also widely accepted that the plasma membrane is laterally heterogeneous containing nanoscopic regions enriched in certain types of lipids, which have different physical properties from the surrounding lipids [1]. These functional domains, commonly referred to as rafts, have been implicated in a wide range of cellular functions, including signal transduction, drug uptake, and interactions with pathogens. In recent years, we have used small angle neutron scattering to study nanoscopic lipid domains in model membrane systems [2-4], and more recently in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Data from these studies will be presented, including evidence for the existence of lipid nanodomains in a living prokaryote system, implying that lipid organization is a feature that has likely evolved over time, eventually becoming an integral property of biological membranes. 1.

With POC testing, the turn-around time can be significantly reduced, leading to earlier decision making and more efficient medical treatment. At present, POC protocols are predominantly based on rapid-test immunoassay strips/cassettes that combine gold nanoparticles for colorimetric (mostly qualitative) detection and flow-through systems for sample delivery. Optical disc technology provides a promising alternative to today s POC testing protocol; we have established both the surface chemistry and signal reading methodology for running bioassays of various molecular analytes on bona fide optical discs (CD, DVD, and Blu-ray discs); these bioDiscs can be read quantitatively with standard computer drives or stand-alone disc players, i.e., without any modifications to the hardware and software driver.

Calgary) October 12, 2016, 10:30 a.m.   11:30 a.m. The fundamental nutritional requirements of cells are common to almost all living organisms. However, evolutionary pressures have radically diversified the strategies organisms use to meet these demands. One of the most extreme contrasts in nutritional strategies can be found in host-pathogen metabolic exchanges. Host organisms supply a predictable supply of nutrients to their cells despite dietary diversity, unpredictable energy output, and famine. Pathogens, by contrast, avoid nutritional adversity by stealing from their host. The nutrients pathogens come to rely on, and their strategies for acquiring these molecules, have a direct bearing on the severity and clinical presentation of infections. The Lewis laboratory specializes in unraveling these complex host/pathogen metabolic interactions using high-resolution mass spectrometry and multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. I will discuss the unique challenges one must overcome when unravelling these complex multi-organism metabolic systems and describe how the unique metabolic selective forces have shaped the evolution of human pathogens. Dr. Ian Lewis is an Assistant Professor and Alberta Innovates Health Solutions (AIHS) Translational Health Chair in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Calgary. The Lewis laboratory specializes in harnessing metabolomics technology to understand the role metabolism plays in infectious diseases. The goal of this research is to develop new diagnostic methods to identify high risk patients and novel antimicrobial therapies to control infections. One of the key challenges in this research program is unraveling the complex host-pathogen metabolic dynamics that occur during infections. The Lewis group addresses this challenge using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology. Recently, Dr. Lewis launched the Calgary Metabolomics Research Facility (CMRF) a mass spectrometry facility that was designed specifically to meet the unique challenges faced in metabolomics. Dr. Lewis was recruited to Alberta from Princeton University, where he conducted his postdoctoral research with Drs. Manuel Llin s and Joshua Rabinowitz in the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics. During his time at Princeton, Dr. Lewis investigated central carbon metabolism in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Dr. Lewis earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin under the direction of Dr. John Markley. His thesis work generated a suite of analytical and bioinformatics tools for investigating metabolites in complex biological extracts.

Recent biomineralization research in vertebrates has identified, characterized and described functions for key noncollagenous extracellular matrix proteins regulating crystal growth in the skeleton and dentition by binding to mineral.  Gene mutations affecting mineral-regulating proteins typically lead to bone and tooth nanocrystallites defective in number, size, shape and/or orientation, and can even potentially lead to changes in mineral type, such that these otherwise hard tissues become diseased, soft and/or brittle.  Several bone and tooth diseases will be discussed in terms of altered molecular determinants of mineralization. Some of these same proteins expressed in soft tissues undergoing pathologic calcification (like blood vessels) also inhibit ectopic crystal growth.  In calcium carbonate biomineralizing systems like inner ear otoconia and avian eggshells, similar proteins likewise regulate mineralization.  In addition to peptides and proteins, we also show that calcium carbonate (vaterite) chirality effects can be induced by chiral acidic amino acids.  This work was funded by CIHR and NSERC. Dr. McKee is Full Professor (James McGill Professor), past FRSQ Chercheur-National, and previously Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and Research (just completed after 17 years) in the Faculty of Dentistry at McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  He also has a joint appointment in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology in the Faculty of Medicine.  Dr. McKee obtained his Ph.D. in Anatomy and Cell Biology at McGill University, and completed a post-doctoral fellowship at Harvard University (and The Children s Hospital) in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery in Boston.  Following almost a year at the Forsyth Institute in Boston, Dr. McKee spent 8 years at University of Montreal before moving to McGill in 1998. Dr. McKee s research program focuses on the mechanisms regulating biomineralization in bones, teeth and other biomineralizing systems, and more specifically, on the role of proteins in controlling the growth of calcium-phosphate and calcium-carbonate crystals in extracellular matrices.  He also studies pathologic calcification in tissues that do not normally mineralize.  His research is relevant to bone and tooth diseases affecting mineralization (the osteomalacias), and to debilitating calcification pathologies seen in, for example, cardiovascular disease (notably atherosclerosis, Monckeberg s sclerosis and end-stage renal disease), urolithiasis (kidney stones) and arthritis.

To counter this, over the past 10 years, my colleagues and I have modified our courses such that we do considerably less  telling  in classes, and we have redefined the professor s role as a facilitator of learning. With the wealth of information available online and in textbooks, we ask students to come to class prepared and complete a pre-class reading quiz. This preparation primes them for in-class learning and frees up valuable class time to spend on more difficult concepts and maximize time spent with their instructors, who are experts in the discipline.  My talk will focus on our use of student pre-class preparation, and the feedback it provides, and collaborative learning strategies to drive student conceptual understanding and critical thinking. In-class, we use Peer Instruction with clickers providing students with the benefits of collaborative learning.  These activities provide students with practice in constructing their own knowledge for a more lasting impact and provides both them and the instructor with immediate and valuable feedback on student understanding. Recently, we adopted two-stage exams as an effective collaborative learning tool that provides rapid feedback while maintaining personal accountability. Here students write the test independently and then immediately after, write the same or similar test in small groups. Two-stage exams turn tests into unique learning opportunities and capitalize on the natural tendency for students to want to discuss their exam immediately after writing it. This approach for exams is also reported to improve students' performance on subsequent individual tests (Gilley & Clarkston, 2014). We have used the two-stage approach in a large (260-500 students) genetics course, not only for tests, but also for tutorials of up to 48 students. In this seminar, I ll introduce research and facilitate a discussion of things we can do to make our time more enjoyable and productive and our classrooms more effective at building young scientists.  Tamara Kelly is an Associate Lecturer and Undergraduate Program Director in the Department of Biology at York University in Toronto, Ontario. She received her PhD in Human Genetics from McGill University, and then was a postdoctoral Science Teaching and Learning Fellow with the Carl Wieman Science Education Initiative at the University of British Columbia.

Saskatchewan) November 2, 2016, 10:30 a.m.   11:30 a.m. High pressure liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) methods are developed to quantify 50 highly polar, low molecular-weight urine metabolites that were suggested as potential biomarkers for respiratory illnesses, such as asthma and COPD. Target metabolites were classified based on their functional groups into amines and phenols (group-1), carboxylic acids (group-2), and miscellaneous (group-3). Groups 1 and 2 contain 42 metabolites and were analyzed based on the differential isotope labeling (DIL) approach using C12/C13 labeled derivatizing reagents. Dansyl chloride (DNS-Cl) and dimethylaminophenacyl bromide reagent (DmPA) were selected for the derivatization of groups 1 and 2, respectively. The derivatization allows for the successful separation of the metabolites on a C18 column using gradient elution, while enhancing the MS response during positive electrospray ionization. Despite complexity, the developed methods were successfully validated according to the FDA guidelines. However, existing regulatory guidelines is established for xenobiotics compounds rather than endogenous ones, resulting in many challenges during the method validation process. Clinical data showed promising separation of COPD and asthma patients based on their quantitative metabolomic profiles.

Under such conditions, bacterial stress responses induce protective mechanisms to ensure bacterial survival under stress. My group studies the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and how the stringent response, a conserved starvation and stress response, mediates multidrug tolerance. In particular, regulation of oxidative stress pathways by the stringent response modulates antibiotic lethality, and targeting such pathways may be a novel approach to sensitize tolerant bacteria to conventional antibiotic therapies.

With the recent advances in femtosecond spectroscopy, which now permit the observation of chemical reactions in real time, there is an ever increasing interest in such theoretical studies, as they can predict, explain and guide experiments. In particular, molecular dynamics simulations allow one to simulate the motion of atoms and molecules at the microscopic level as chemical reactions occur, providing invaluable information about their molecular mechanisms and kinetics. Dynamical studies are essential since they provide a link between potential energy surfaces determined by electronic structure calculations and experimental measurements of the chemical dynamics and thermodynamics. Because chemical reactions occur in various phases of nature, our research involves reactive systems in the gas phase, condensed phases, and clusters, which are considered to be novel intermediate states of matter. Clusters can be used as tools for selective microsolvation, or they can be a distinct class of materials with unique properties. Our computer simulations typically involve high-performance scientific computing on state-of-the art workstations and supercomputers, and we make use of a wide arsenal of computational tools which take their roots in quantum chemistry, classical and quantum mechanics, and statistical thermodynamics. Extensive use is made of semiempirical, approximate and ab initio electronic structure theory, both in the gas-phase and in solution, molecular modeling, molecular dynamics and pioneering first-principles simulation techniques. We are particularly interested in studying solvation effects and dynamics in liquids and small clusters, organic and biologically relevant reactions, photochemical processes, metal and semiconductor cluster fragmentation, environmentally and technologically relevant chemical reactions, cluster and materials science in general. We maintain an intensive collaboration with renown experimentalists worldwide, as connection with experiment is crucial for assessing the reliability of our computer simulations and theoretical models, which, in turn can be used to improve our fundamental understanding of chemistry.

I also employ molecular modelling to understand tropospheric photochemical reactions, especially in an urban air quality context. I have significant field experience in developing and deploying analytical instrumentation in the High Arctic. Currently, I am interested in statistical analysis of medium sized data sets (up to 500,000 observations), including multivariate data analysis of partially dichotomous data. I am very much interested interpreting measurement data for the application and validation of atmospheric chemistry models. My main statistical tools for data analysis are  Matlab  and  R . I use the CAABA/MECCA box model for atmospheric molecular modelling. My current research focuses on long-term observations of urban pollutants in major Canadian cities. The research is comprised of statistical analysis of 1o  year pollution data and atmospheric modelling using the box model  MECCA/CAABA  and multivariate chemometric modelling in Matlab and R. Until recently, I was a collaborator on the  EU funded FP7 MYCOSPEC project , where I perform multivariate modelling of mid-infrared data for classification of contaminated agricultural commodities. I have recently explored non-parametric machine learning algorithms such as bagged decision trees. Previously, I was a lead author and chapter coordinator for the Canadian Mercury Science Assessment for the \"Emissions\" Chapter. I have also conducted a statistical evaluation of gaseous and reactive mercury species data from observations and model results. All mercury work was done in collaboration with Environment Canada. During field studies in the High Arctic (in Alert, NU and Barrow, AK), I investigated the exchange of volatile organic compounds between snow and air using GC-FID and GC-MS.

Most of my work has been done with yeast or mammalian enolases, which are dimeric. What is the relationship between the quaternary structure of the protein and its activity? What are the conformational changes that occur during catalysis? The protein is being perturbed by mutagenesis and by changing solution conditions (salts, hydrostatic and osmotic pressure). The effects of these perturbations are being monitored by a combination of kinetics, spectroscopic studies (uv, fluorescence and circular dichroism) and by analytical ultracentrifugation (quaternary structure). These experiments are being guided by the recognition that the precise conformation of the protein affects both subunit interactions and catalysis and that perturbing one often perturbs the other. This is especially true for many of the variant enolases that we have produced by site-directed mutagenesis. How does the active site communicate with the subunit interface? My group has recently begun to work on the enolase from streptococci. This enzyme is octomeric. How do its properties - catalytic activity, stability, etc - compare with those of the dimeric enolases? Can we convert the octomeric enolase into a dimeric enolase? If so, what happens to catalytic activity?

Herein, we report the anionic polymerization of allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) on methoxy-PEG (mPEG) as macroinitiator to produce the diblock copolymer mPEG-b-PAGE. The mPEG-b-PAGE copolymer was then used as a common precursor to generate a systematic series of copolymers derivatized with pendant alkyl chains via thiolene click chemistry. These amphiphilic block copolymers were found to self-assemble in aqueous solution to form aggregates with distinct and unique morphologies. Depending on the hydrophobic weight fraction of the copolymer, spheres, long filomicelles, rods, disks and polymersomes with confirmed biocompatibility were formed. These materials were evaluated in terms of ability to solubilize the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). For each copolymer, stable micelle formulations were prepared that included high DOX to copolymer ratios of up to 20 % (wt%) with drug loading efficiencies > 60 % (w/w). In vitro drug release studies, conducted under physiologically relevant conditions, revealed sustained release profiles. Assessment of cytotoxicity in OVCAR8 human ovarian cancer cells grown in monolayers and spheroids confirmed that the activity of the formulated drug was conserved. The promising preliminary assessment of these alkylated copolymers encourages additional evaluation in vivo. Dr. Le D v dec carried out his undergraduate degree in biochemistry at UQAM. Under the supervision of Prof. M.A Mateescu, he completed his MSc in biochemistry in 2008 (with Honors). His work focused on the development of chromatographic devices for the separation of chitosan oligomers and the synthesis of polyalkylated chitosan for oral delivery. In 2008, he carried out his PhD, under the supervision of Prof. Julian Zhu at the University of Montreal, where he developed his skills in polymer chemistry and novel polymer drug delivery systems. After a brief time in the pharmaceutical industry, he moved to Ontario where he is currently carrying out his postdoctoral research in the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto, with Christine Allen. His research interests focus on the development and characterization of copolymers for sustained release of hydrophobic drugs from nano-scale delivery system to implantable devices, as well as the study of drug-polymer compatibility and the tunable morphology of drug carrier.

November 25, 2016, 2:30 p.m.   3:30 p.m. Synthetic photochemistry has experienced a tremendous resurgence in interest. Photochemistry is viewed as a  green  strategy for organic synthesis, and new developments in photocatalysis employing visible light, as well as enabling technologies like continuous flow techniques, have all likely contributed to renewed interest in exploited photochemical activation as a tool in synthesis. The development of new Cu-based heteroleptic photocatalysts, their uses in synthesis and comparison with existing UV light-mediated reactions will be discussed. Shawn K. Collins was born in 1974 and raised in Val d'Or, Qu bec. He obtained a B.Sc. (Honours) degree from Concordia University in 1996 while working with Professor Ozzie S. Tee.

It's Science Literacy Week   on September 21, flex your research skills at a Concordia University Library Wikipedia edit-a-thon Posted on September 19, 2016 | By: Tom Peacock Ready for a Wikipedia update? Ursula Franklin was one of Canada's most accomplished scientists and educators. Her research helped sway world opinion against nuclear weapons testing during the Cold War. In celebration of  Science Literacy Week  (Sept. 19-25), the Concordia news desk is highlighting a related activity every day. See Tuesday's 6 cool Concordia science courses for non-scientists  and Wednesday's  Rocketry and robotics at Space Concordia . If you ve ever wanted to learn how to fix a typo, add a citation or create a whole new article on the world s most popular online encyclopedia , now s your chance. In celebration of Science Literacy Week, Concordia University Library is partnering with McGill Library to host a  Women in Science Wikipedia edit-a-thon this Wednesday, September 21. The event will focus on editing, improving and writing Wikipedia content about women who contributed to the sciences.  Editing scientist entries in Wikipedia is a great way to meld science with information literacy skills,  says Krista Alexander , chemistry, biochemistry and physics subject librarian and co-organizer of the event.  It showcases the importance of thinking critically about the information sources students are using and citing those sources properly.  While the event is focused on women in science, all are welcome to participate and no Wikipedia editing experience is necessary. The Concordia University Library views the event as an inclusive opportunity to learn.  Wikipedia is the most comprehensive encyclopedia we currently have, but it s a work in progress,  explains Pamela Carson , web wervices librarian.  It s a crowd-sourced project and each of us has the ability to make it a little more comprehensive, complete and correct. I d like students to understand how information gets on Wikipedia, and learning how to edit Wikipedia reveals this process.  The edit-a-thon will start at 2 p.m. with a brief tutorial on how to edit Wikipedia. This will be followed by a group editing session, where experienced Wikipedia editors and librarians will help participants one-on-one and answer questions. Assistance will be provided for Wikipedia newcomers as needed throughout the event and drop-in participation is welcome. Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops if they have them, but laptops can also be borrowed from the Circulation Desk on LB-2. Carson says an academic library is the perfect setting for a Wikipedia edit-a-thon, mainly because it s a great place to do research.  We have access to millions of scholarly articles and books which can be used as high-quality sources to support assertions made in Wikipedia.  Concordia's Women in Science Wikipedia edit-a-thon takes place this Wednesday, September 21, between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. in Room LB-322 of the Webster Library, located in the  J.W. McConnell (LB) Building  (1400 De Maisonneuve W.).

Any form of unauthorized collaboration, cheating, copying or plagiarism which are suspected will be reported, and the appropriate sanctions applied. The seminar the Department offers is a clear and fair opportunity to learn what our faculty regards as academic misconduct. Failure to take part in this learning opportunity and thus ignorance of these regulations is no excuse and will not result in a reduced sanction in any case where academic misconduct is observed. The Academic Code for Students Taking Chemistry or Biochemistry Courses As part of most courses given by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, you are required to: Attend a Chemistry and Biochemistry Departmental Seminar on the academic conduct code and the appropriate use of information sources. Several are given near the start of each term. Pass the online quiz associated with this seminar (note: the passing grade for the quiz is 100%). Note: This is NOT the University's quiz you may have been asked to take when you first registered and logged into the myConcordia portal; the one you must take is similar, but graded by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and you cannot take it until after you have attended a seminar. The aim of this seminar is to clarify the academic conduct code in terms of what practices will be considered unacceptable with regards to work submitted for grading in Chemistry and Biochemistry courses. You are only exempt from repeating the seminar and the quiz if you have done both in Fall 2011 or more recently ( see list ), otherwise you are required to repeat both this term. Please note that the list is not computer searchable: you will need to look for your ID number youself. This short seminar (less than 1 hour) will be held at the following times and locations. Note that late-comers will not be admitted. Dates (Winter 2017) CC-310 Summer 2017 - TBA in April As space for each of the seminars is limited by the room size, please sign up for your preferred time. Sign up sheets will be available outside SP 201.01 (Departmental office) after the beginning of the semester. Note: You will be asked to sign an attendance sheet at the seminar to prove you really did attend. If you do not complete this course requirement, at the discretion of your professor, your final grade for the course may be lowered by as much as one full letter grade with an incomplete notation until such time as this requirement is completed. Please refer to the undergraduate calendar ( section 16.3.6 ) and the FAQ below for details on removal of an incomplete notation. The Winter 2017 quiz will close at 23:55 on Sunday, March 5th 2017.   Frequently Asked Questions I did the quiz when I first registered at Concordia. So I have nothing more to do, right? That quiz was a voluntary one offered by the University, and the Department has no access to the results. You have to do the one created by the Department which is only accessible on the CHEM101 Moodle site after you attend the seminar. I keep trying the quiz but I can never get 110/110. Is there something I am doing wrong, or is there a bug in the quiz? You have probably not read any of the warnings (and there are several) about questions with two acceptable answers. For such questions you must select both these answers to get full marks. It is possible to check more than one box. When I finished the quiz, I think it told me I got 110/110 but now I am no longer sure. Is there any way I can check my mark Yes, just go back to the quiz and you can view the record of your score(s) and even your answers, with the feedback, at each attempt. The grade I got in my course is much lower than I expected. Is it because I did not get 100% on the quiz yet? Possibly, but you would also have received an INC notation if that was a issue. There may be many other reasons, so please check with your course instructor. I got 102.5/110 on the quiz. Surely that is good enough? No it is not. You have to get 100% if it is a course requirement. The consequences of a misunderstanding of what is, and what is not, permitted under the University's Academic Code of Conduct can be very serious. We want to make sure you know all the rules. I received an INC grade last semester because I had not attended the seminar. What must I do to get it removed? You will have a chance to attend one of a number seminars given early (usually in the second or third week) in the coming semester. You must attend one, and then do the associated quiz. You will also have to go the Registrar's Services (Birks Student Service Centre downtown), and apply for a \"late completion grade\": your Professor(s) cannot put through a grade change unless you have completed this formality (which will cost $20 per course). Check the application deadlines below: it may already be too late. If so, see question 8 below. Deadlines: Winter Term: May 15th  Summer term: Sepember 1st I received an INC grade last semester because I had not done the quiz. What must I do to get it removed? You must get yourself registered to do the quiz: contact Prof.  P. Bird  or Prof.  H. Muchall . (See 9. below.) Do the quiz as soon as possible. You will also have to go the Registrar's Services (Birks Student Service Centre downtown), and apply for a \"late completion grade\": your Professor(s) cannot put through a grade change unless you have completed this formality (which will cost you $25 per course). Check the deadlines in item 6 above: it may already be too late. If so, see question 8 below. I only just noticed that I got an INC and the deadline has passed. What can I do now? You will have to get permission from the Faculty of Arts and Science (Student Services) before Registrar's Services will allow you to apply late for a \"late completion grade\". Go to room AD 202, or the Chemistry Department office, SP 201.01, and pick up a Faculty of Arts and Science Student request form, or  download  a copy. Fill it in, and see Prof. P. Bird (x3367) or Prof. C. DeWolf (x3378) in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry for a supporting note. Take them to AD 202. I did the seminar and quiz a year ago. Must I do them again? No, you have to have done it within the last five years. There is a list where you can check - see  above the seminar schedule . I did the seminar in a previous semester, but never did the quiz, and now I cannot access it. What must I do? You should e-mail Professor  Bird  or Muchall who can confirm that you have attended the seminar, and then register you for the quiz. Please be sure to give your student number, and say when you attended the seminar. I have forgotten if I already did the seminar and/or quiz. How can I find out? If you cannot remember whether you did these things, you probably cannot remember what you learned either, and should probably do them again! But see 8. above. I am an engineering student taking one pre-requisite Chem course. Surely I do not have to do the seminar and quiz? Oh yes you do!

From astronomy to culinary chemistry, these educational offerings will whet your appetite Posted on September 20, 2016 | By: Meagan Boisse  Did you enjoy The Martian? If so, we may have a course for you.  | Image: Twentieth Century Fox In celebration of Science Literacy Week (Sept. 19-25), the Concordia news desk is highlighting a related activity every day. See Monday's Wiki for women in STEM!  and Wednesday's  Rocketry and robotics at Space Concordia . So you re not a scientist. But like anyone with an inquisitive mind, you still grapple with life s existential questions: Who are you? What are you? Where did you come from? How close to reality is Jurassic Park? Good news! You don t need be an expert to explore the realms of science and space. Concordia offers a myriad of courses that address some of these fundamental queries while exploring a range of subjects, from the vast expanses of the universe to the tiniest life-giving particles.   General Biology  Do you want to know why you need to eat food and breathe oxygen? The difference between science and pseudoscience? Or what your ancient ancestors looked like? Then General Biology is for you,  says Madoka Gray-Mitsumune , who teaches BIOL 202: General Biology. The course covers the fundamentals of biology and the chemistry of life. Learn about the structure and functions of cells and tissues, as well as aspects of anatomy, physiology, taxonomy, heredity and evolution.  It s designed for non-scientists who are still curious about life. Through it you will learn the makings of life using everyday examples,  says Gray-Mitsumune.   Fundamental Nutrition Where does cooking and science collide? In BIOL 203: Fundamental Nutrition, of course, where you ll take a hands-on approach to food composition.  Cooking teaches us food chemistry. Thankfully, every home still comes equipped with a kitchen,  says instructor Catherine Calogeropoulos , who teaches her students the science of nutrition through an array of culinary experiments. Can you use milk in a sauce recipe that calls for cream? Probably not, says Calogeropoulos. Relative to milk, cream contains a lot less protein. Under high heat, milk can cause the sauce to curdle   and make you look like a foolish foodie.  Science reveals itself magically before our eyes in the kitchen. By perusing the molecular gastronomy literature I ve found perfect cooking examples to anchor nearly all the scientific concepts that might elude my students and senior auditors,  she says.   Fundamentals of Health and Physical Activity This course touches upon a range of topics: cardiovascular and muscular fitness, flexibility, weight management, nutrition, disease prevention and even stress management.  Students will gain both knowledge and tools to maximize their health and energy, immediately and in the long term,  says instructor Leslie Barker, who teaches EXCI 251: Fundamentals of Health and Physical Activity.  Many students comment that EXCI 251 helped them improve their own negative eating, smoking, stress and inactivity habits, while they also learned to differentiate between scientific facts and marketing hype,  adds Barker.   Forensic Analysis Everyone knows that DNA analysis revolutionized forensics, but how? If you want to find out,  Cameron Skinner , associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, suggests you take CHEM 298 AA.  Our approach is to first learn the underlying principles by starting with the basics such as molecules, chemical reactions and so on, before working our way towards the sophisticated tools used in a modern forensics lab,  says Skinner.  You will finish the course with a more realistic understanding of the field of forensics. You'll also understand the capacities and limitations of modern analysis. Some of the lessons will be case studies, some will be drawn from the textbook ... and there will be an occasional poisoning and/or murder.  Please note: Skinner says he will not take responsibility for any damages or strife caused when you begin yelling at your TV during crime shows such as CSI.   Discovering Biotechnology  Did you enjoy The Martian?  Were you thrilled by Jurassic Park?  Did Gattaca give you pause for thought? If so, we may have a course for you,  says Paul Joyce , a professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Concordia. CHEM 209: Discovering Biotechnology begins with an exploration of the roles that genes and proteins play in life processes. It then examines the basic principles behind the manipulation of biological molecules to produce desired changes. The course also explores the ethical ramifications of such actions.  Would you like to know how close we are to establishing a base on Mars? Or if we can really clone dinosaurs (or people, for that matter)? Or how close we are to the spectre of genetic discrimination?  asks Joyce.  Then register for this course.    Introduction to Astronomy Black holes, constellations, the Milky Way galaxy and beyond   PHYS 284: Introduction to Astronomy is the course for anyone interested in space.  Students will be introduced to advanced topics from cosmology, including the Big Bang theory, as well as the study of extra-solar planets and the search for extraterrestrial life,  says Mario D Amico from Concordia s Department of Physics. PHYS 284 will be offered as an online course this winter session. Browse through multimedia components and narrated lectures on major topics in astronomy, from the comfort of your own couch.  Students will have the flexibility of taking the course using their computers. They will therefore not be required to travel, or even be located in Montreal,  adds D'Amico.   Register online through the MyConcordia portal for these classes. Space is limited.

Which is where these two Concordia graduate students come in... Maniya Aghasibeig is a PhD candidate with the Electro-Catalytic Green Engineering Group  and the  Thermal Spray Laboratory in the  Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering . Cindy Buonomano is a PhD student in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry  and president of the Chemistry and Biochemistry Graduate Student Association.   Why did you become a scientist or an engineer? Cindy Buonomano:  Ever since I was a little girl, I've known I wanted to be a scientist. I read scientific magazines, watched scientific TV shows and made my own observations from scientific experiments. Cindy Buonomano Naturally, in school, I oriented my education towards science and, more specifically, chemistry. I was interested in finding out how everything works on a molecular level. Chemistry has brought many great moments of joy to my life. In high school, I was able to travel to Paris for a contest when I was only 17 years old. And now, here I am in Quebec to realize my dreams and maybe become a professor who can inspire other young scientists. Maniya Aghasibeig: I became fascinated with materials science after I took a high school course on the subject, and got familiar with various types of materials (metals, ceramics, polymers etc.) with different structures and properties. A year later, just prior to choosing an undergraduate major, I met someone who studied in the field, and he explained to me about its diversity and its flexibility: it can be used in many different technologies, from aerospace to health care. That was when I knew that I wanted to study in this field. Usually when I first contact people by email and introduce myself as a PhD candidate who studies mechanical engineering, they assume that I am a guy. Later, when we meet in person or speak on the phone, they are very surprised to see/hear a girl! Tell us about what you're researching now, and why. CB: I am currently a PhD student in organic chemistry. I decided to take the PhD path because I want to be a professor. In the last few years, while supervising undergraduate students, I discovered a true passion for teaching. In organic chemistry, our goal is to build drugs or molecules with a potential material application. To do it, we have to develop new methods to synthesize these interesting molecules. My research project is \"Synthesis of Heteroaromatic Compounds via Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling and Directed Ortho-Metalation Reactions.\" Maniya Aghasibeig MA: I work on manufacturing nickel electrodes using different thermal spraying techniques for hydrogen production by water electrolysis. This hydrogen can be stored, converted and used later   for instance, for electricity production with no emissions other than water vapour. The need for green and renewable energy resources arises from increasing concerns about the depletion of fossil fuels, in addition to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming that occur alongside the fast development of modern industries. These manufactured electrodes are expected to increase the efficiency of the water electrolysis process by increasing the rate of hydrogen production and lowering the process costs.  Were you inspired by other women in your field? MA: My mentor was my boss from my last industrial job: Barbara Maroli at H gan s AB in Sweden. She was extremely knowledgeable, determined and successful in her career. She became my role model the first day I met her. When I told her that I wanted to study for a PhD she was truly encouraging and supportive. She helped me to explore my options and make a decision with confidence. CB: Many women inspired me, like  Marie Curie , who got the Nobel Prize in chemistry and in physics, and  Valentina Tereshkova , the first woman to go to space. I told my little self that if these women were able to go that far, why can't I? I've had so many people in my life tell me that I would not succeed in my studies and I should stop. I am glad I never listened to them! It is hard to be a woman in a world dominated by male scientists, but trust me: you are as good as them. So be strong, and inspire other little girls to do the same. Find out how to study  mechanical and industrial engineering  or  chemistry and biochemistry  at Concordia.

With governments like Quebec s looking to  ban organic waste  from landfills by 2020, we need to act fast to reduce the amount of food scraps we re throwing out.  A study recently published in  Waste Management  by researchers from Concordia s Faculty of Arts and Science  shows that one method of composting could yield high quality compost and high value by-products. The catch? There are worms involved.  The study s lead author, Louise H nault-Ethier, carried out her research while pursuing a master s from what is now Concordia s Individualized program. She experimented with different methods of vermicomposting to see whether they could sufficiently inactivate certain bacteria for safe public use of the compost.   Centralized composting, which is one of the fastest growing industrial composting methods, has strict governmental guidelines, requiring thermal sanitation to prevent the survival of harmful bacteria,  she says. The guidelines require that the compost reaches and maintains a heat of 55 degrees Celsius over a period of three days in a self-heating process driven by decomposer microorganisms found in the compost.   But in our case, worms graze on the decomposer community, preventing the onset of high temperatures. We wanted to see if vermicomposting, which proceeds at room temperature could still get rid of harmful bacteria.  H nault-Ethier worked with Concordia chemistry professor Yves G linas and biology professor  Vincent Martin to examine the impact of vermicomposting on E. coli, a bacteria often found in fecal matter that can easily make its way into organic waste set to be composted.  They devised three experiments to monitor the presence of E. coli, testing whether the size of the batch of compost, the amount of naturally occurring compost microbes and the rate at which the compost was fed would affect the survival of the pathogen.  Time and again, the worms worked their magic and eventually produced compost that respected the regulatory bacterial count limits. When the normal compost microbes or worms were present, E. coli declined more rapidly. Without worms or with sterile compost, it took a little more time to get there.   \"We found that the compost batches take on average 18 to 21 days to decrease the E. coli to levels well below the legal limit,  explains G linas, who worked closely with H nault-Ethier to examine how the chemicals, such as Carbon, Nitrogen or sugars, present in the compost materials would affect the bacteria s survival.  While that's slower than traditional composting methods, it s not a prohibitive amount of time.\"  Upcycling waste  For H nault-Ethier, who was recently named head of scientific projects for the David Suzuki Foundation , it s the added benefits of vermicomposting that are most important, beyond the results of the E. coli survival experiments. \"The compost it produces may lead to higher plant yields when used as a fertilizer, and   even more surprising  the red wigglers themselves could then be reused as feed for other animals on the food chain,  she says. This is what's called  upcycling    generating something more valuable than the initial waste product. Although the idea of using invertebrates as animal feed may seem a little strange, it s actually a proven method for potentially replacing the resource-intensive soybeans or fish meal traditionally used.  \"This study suggests that upcycling technologies like vermicomposting can be more widely developed for commercial use,  says H nault-Ethier. As a past environmental coordinator for Concordia, she spearheaded a large-scale worm-farming project in which 15 tons of the university s waste were composted per year.  Though traditional compost can rapidly kill potential pathogens through heat, industrial composting may actually take longer to reach maturity than vermicomposting. Why not wait a little longer to see pathogen declines in vermicomposting and then create a product that provides nutrient-rich feed to both plants and animals? It's a win-win situation.\" The results show that vermicomposting is a promising method in the sanitation of organic waste, which would allow for producing proteins for animal feed. That said, while the E. coli inactivation observed in the current study is promising, H nault-Ethier cautions that further research on a more diverse array of pathogens is still required.

Held on November 12 and 13 in Pointe-Claire s Stewart Hall, the event offered close to 1,800 visitors the chance to participate in interactive scientific displays on topics ranging from the chemistry of ice cream to the effects of climate change on the planet.  We always like to say Exposcience is for children aged one to 90,  says Miriam Posner, manager of planning and academic facilities for the  Faculty of Arts and Science .  When you see the children s eyes light up as they explore the exhibitions, you really understand why we do this every year. It fosters a sense of fascination and promotes the value of community. It also demonstrates that Concordia is a leader when it comes to getting the next generation interested in science.     A wonderful outreach  Fellow organizer Cameron Tilson, assistant director in institutional planning and analysis, first became involved with Exposcience in 1984.  It represents a wonderful outreach to our community,  he says.  Our students are some of our best ambassadors. This event gives them an opportunity to talk about and demonstrate the work they are doing with members of the public.  Tilson adds that over the years he s spoken to numerous current and former Concordia students who insist that attending Exposcience was one of the reasons they entered their field of study and chose to attend the university.   Drones, dune buggies and electrocardiograms Every year, new exhibitions are offered, and this year was no exception. Audiences got to take in a display featuring a newly purchased drone from the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment . It streamed pictures taken by a multi-spectral camera, which captures image data at specific frequencies across the  electromagnetic spectrum . Meanwhile, the Department of Psychology s table featured three exhibitions: associate professor Jennifer McGrath showed individuals their heart beats using electrocardiograms; assistant professor Kristen Dunfield and her students demonstrated how developmental researchers approach testing in children, investigating issues such as the development of morality and theory of mind; and associate professor Aaron Johnson s display included a game of Where s Waldo to demonstrate eye tracking. The Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science also joined in the fun. The Concordia SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) display was once again a crowd favourite, allowing visitors to experience a rocky ride while strapped into a dune buggy. Meanwhile, students from the UAV Concordia (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) student society allowed visitors to examine Aerial technology up close.  It s always rewarding to know we are fostering curiosity about science and technology,  says Posner. Learn more about Concordia s Faculty of Arts and Science .

How can we use pressure perturbation to map protein folding landscapes and probe the molecular origins of protein folding cooperativity? We have discovered recently that the major cause for pressure induced unfolding is the elimination of packing defects present in protein folded states. This mechanism, which depends on specific and structurally heterogeneous properties of the folded states of proteins, is distinct from heat and chemical denaturation, the effects of which depend rather homogeneously upon the amount of surface area exposed to solvent in the unfolded states of proteins. This local effect of pressure, in combination with site specific NMR experiments, SAXS, fluorescence, pressure perturbation calorimetry and other biophysical techniques has allowed detailed structural and energetic mapping of protein folding landscapes, and the effects of mutations thereon. We have found for example that single mutations can change a very simple folding pathway into a very complex one with multiple parallel routes. We are currently using pressure coupled with the above mentioned techniques applied to repeat proteins in a systematic study of the sequence and structural determinants of folding cooperativity.

We can float these disks on a Langmuir trough and apply known torques to oscillate the disks to evaluate the surface viscosity and elasticity of lipid monolayers. As an alternative, we rotate 5 micron long, 300 nm diameter nickel wires in a magnetic field at the air-water interface. The small size of the disks and wires gives us sensitivity to small values of the surface viscosity that were impossible to access with macroscopic probes.  We find that a surprising number of monolayers exhibit a Newtonian response with a constant surface viscosity over a range of surface pressures.  We can identify second order phase transitions difficult to find with isotherms or X-ray diffraction methods. The composition dependence of surface viscosity is also surprising. Adding small fractions of cholesterol decreases the interfacial viscosity of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) monolayers by an order of magnitude per wt%.  Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction shows that cholesterol at these small fractions does not mix ideally with DPPC, but rather induces nano-phase separated structures of an ordered, primarily DPPC phase bordered by a line-active, disordered, mixed DPPC-cholesterol phase. We propose that the free area in the classic Cohen and Turnbull model of viscosity is inversely proportional to the number of molecules in the coherence area, or product of the two coherence lengths.  Cholesterol significantly reduces the coherence area of the crystals as well as the interfacial viscosity. Using this free area collapses the surface viscosity data for all surface pressures and cholesterol fractions to a universal logarithmic relation.

We have developed the  precursor alcohol atmospheric reaction and transport  or PAART theory to potentially explain these observations. Residual fluoro-alcohols are significant in fluorinated polymers and surfactants (food contact paper coatings) and may contribute significantly to the global burden, though we know little about the stability of the linkage chemistry within the fluorinated materials. Experiments have shown the ester and phosphate esters in monomers and surfactants are readily hydrolyzed through microbial and mammalian metabolism. The fluoroalcohols (e.g. FTOHs) are readily oxidized, via reactive intermediates, to the resulting PFCAs. Some of these intermediates have been shown to be highly toxic to D. Magna (ie 10:2 FTCA) or readily react with GSH (the acrylic aldehydes). These fluoroalcohols are also readily found in the atmosphere and have been shown to undergo atmospheric transport and OH driven transformation reactions to yield the observed perfluorinated acids. Model studies suggest significant production of these acids in remote Arctic regions have been confirmed by flux measurements into the ice cap. Temporal studies of biota contamination yield body burdens that appear to closely match production changes by industry. Human contamination is suggestive of an indirect source of exposure through metabolism of the fluorinated alcohols, which would indicate attention to the reactive intermediates is prudent. Evidence suggests many unrecognized organofluorines are present in the environment, some of which may be highly persistent, bioaccumulative, and environmentally problematic. This presentation will highlight the spectacularly interesting environmental chemistry of organofluorines and attempt to delineate the chemical architecture choices in maintaining the positive benefits while avoiding attendant pollution problems.

Their activity is increased in times of metabolic demand (i.e. exercise, fasting, exposure to cold temperatures) to enhance cellular energy production and adapt to the changing nutrient environments. Altered expression and activity of these metabolic regulators is shown in many pathophysiological conditions, suggesting that these proteins may play a significant role in the progression of diseases including hepatosteatosis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. We aim to understand the molecular and physiological consequences of altering PGC-1 expression in different tissues and determine whether targeting this protein family could be beneficial to prevent or treat metabolic disease.

There are various value-added products, namely, adsorbents, bioflocculants, bioplastics, biosurfactants, concrete aggregates, fuel and oil and electricity which have been researched for different technological developments and a few have also been marketed Furthermore, at INRS-ETE, production of various biotechnological value-added products from wastewaters and wastewater sludge, namely, biopesticides and biocontrol agents, enzymes, biofertilizers, bioplastics and bioflocculants is being actively pursued The results are very encouraging in terms of production, mode of action relative to the product, however, a serious question is imposed on the viability of these value-added products in terms of their field application or end-use. It is a known fact that pulp and paper industry wastewaters are laden with various contaminants, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-furans (PCDFs). Moreover, in the last decade, there have been reports of endocrine disrupter compounds (EDCs) pharmaceuticals and personal care product (PPCP) residuals categorised as emerging contaminants in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The existing wastewater treatment processes are not designed to handle these toxic compounds especially at the levels (ng/l or pg/l) in which they reach the WWTPs. Thus, even after treatment, the trace levels of the precursor compound remain or may get transformed into other innocuous metabolites. In this context, these toxic organic compounds end up in the wastewater sludge which is further used for value-addition. Along with the economical benefit of producing value-added products at 40-60% lower cost than the existing commercial products, the toxic component mars the overall objective of wastewater sludge management. Thus, this research envisages the tracing of toxic organic compounds (emerging contaminants) during principal stages of production of biotechnological value-added products along with possible in-situ decontamination and proposal of possible pre-treatment methods and if they can still retain the nutrients for value-addition while removing the emerging contaminants.

But if they were truly as immobile and 'brick-like' as they appear in these images, most would be virtually non-functional. In fact, proteins are constantly undergoing thermally-driven conformational fluctuations - conformational dynamics - in which they briefly adopt higher energy structures that are critical to function. Virtually all of the processes that underlie biological activity - ligand binding, allostery, catalysis and functional control through modification - would be impossible without the ability to 'visit' alternate structures through dynamics. Don't believe me? Try getting your favorite hyperthermophile enzyme to work at room temperature (it won't... at least not very well)... But as vital as it may be, all this moving around, morphing from one shape to another is dangerous. What if these conformational fluctuations go too far? What if we get stuck in 'non-native' structures that are pathogenic? The answer is: Bad stuff happens. Usually to your neurons. In this talk, we'll discuss how we characterize high energy, transient structures in protein function and disease, with a view to 'pacifying' the danger they can sometimes represent.

This assumption is supported by growing evidence showing that helminths may play a protective role in shaping the host immunological response and inducing a balance between the Th1 and Th2 branches of the immune system. The pig whipworm Trichuris suis has become an interesting model to study this phenomenon. Many studies, in humans have clearly shown that T. suis suppresses clinical symptoms of several autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and possibly autism. In fact, T. suis ova are being clinically evaluated as a treatment for IBD. It is known that T. suis excreted/secreted (ES) molecules have immunomodulatory properties and are likely implicated in these immunotherapeutic events. To identify the immunoactive components, we performed proteomic analyses on ES collected in vitro from different life stages of the parasite. Tandem-mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses generated a list of ~300 proteins with temporal expression profiles. Treating immune cells in vitro inhibited stimuli-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-12 and TNF-alpha. More interestingly, these parasite ES alone induced expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Finally, solid phase extractions of parasite conditioned culture media confirmed that small molecular weight metabolites released by the worms have immunomodulatory properties that could act concertedly with proteins to modulate host immune functions. A better understanding of how helminths affect the hosts' immune system may help pave the way to improved therapeutic strategy for autoimmune diseases.

There is great enthusiasm for using digital microfluidics for a wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, and medicine, but until recently, the technique has been limited to applications involving homogeneous liquids. Here, I will present my group's recent work with heterogeneous systems in which droplets of fluid are manipulated in, around, and through solid materials formed from hydrogels, porous polymers, and filter paper. In the first case (Fig. 1a), hydrogel discs on digital microfluidic devices are used to form enzymatic microreactors and to serve as scaffolds for three-dimensional cell culture. In the second case (Fig. 1b), porous polymer monolith (PPM) plugs are formed in situ on digital microfluidic devices to facilitate preparative solid-phase extraction (SPE) for proteomic sample cleanup. In the third case (Fig. 1 c), paper punches bearing dried blood spot (DBS) samples are used for biomarker quantification for screening newborn patients for congenital diseases. When combined with the liquid handling modalities enabled by digital microfluidics (i.e., dispensing reagents and samples from reservoirs, merging, mixing, splitting), we propose that these heterogeneous systems are a powerful new tool for applications in the laboratory and beyond.

There has been tremendous effort devoted to developing what are now commonly referred to as nanocarriers that can help us overcome physicochemical obstacles in their delivery. Lessons learnt from these studies have necessitated a shift in paradigm to combine multiple functions into a single scaffold of a nanostructure. An important parameter for constructing multi-tasking scaffolds is to develop tools, which can be utilized to assemble multivalent structures with desired spatial distribution of therapeutic, stealth, imaging and targeting capabilities. The synthetic methodologies need to be simple and highly versatile, and applicable to a variety of nanoarchitectures. We shall elaborate on the evolution of macromolecule based nanotechnology, demonstrate how one can easily construct multivalent nanoconjugates of desired structural complexity that can perform multiple tasks and help visualize drug delivery, and discuss their potential in smart and efficient therapeutic interventions.

These processes can occur on length scales spanning from the picometer to the nanometer and time scales that span from the femtosecond to the microsecond, so we use special computational methods capable of describing systems that span these scales. In this talk, I will present three applications of these methods by our group. In the first example, we use polarizable molecular dynamics simulations to identify why the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide is able to permeate across cell membranes but water is not [1]. We have also used replica-exchange molecular dynamics and a coarse grain protein model to help elucidate the structure of a protein linked to a genetic disease. In the third example, we use the CHARMM-TURBOMOLE QM/MM program developed in our group [2] to determine why Zn(II) is more soluble in water than Mg(II), despite the fact that the ion-water distances are the same for both ions [3].

In addition scientists work on applied research projects that often involve collaboration with external partners. The main objective of the CCI is to promote the proper care and conservation of Canada s cultural heritage. This presentation will provide an overview of a research project on the characterisation of Canadian amber, and also share the results of two interesting and recent analyses of objects in Canadian collections. Our interest in characterising amber stemmed from requests by archaeologists, who wanted to know if First Nations objects containing amber components found at sites across Canada might actually have originated elsewhere in Canada or Europe, thereby possibly demonstrating early trade of materials. Class Id amber is unique to Canada and has been identified in remote deposit sites in the Canadian high arctic. It has an interesting and important connection to well-known Baltic amber as it is the only other amber in the world to contain a significant abundance of succinic acid. Our research into the structural differences in amber from different deposit sites in Canada led us to uncover the first direct molecular evidence for succinic acid cross-linking of the polymer matrix of both Class Id Canadian amber and Baltic amber. Then, building on a novel pyrolysis technique, we uncovered exiting new evidence of cross-linking in another abundant class of amber, which has not been previously hypothesized. This important discovery may provide new insights into the strength and resilience of these remarkable resins, which have been able to survive for millions of years in harsh environmental conditions. Analyses for museum clients are always varied and often extraordinary. In the second segment of the presentation, I will discuss two different projects: the identification of dyes on ancient burial cloths from Peru, and a case involving wooden African sculptures that began growing mysterious white efflorescence while in storage in Canada.

Ellagitannins feature galloyl units esterified to a sugar core, usually glucose, and characterized by the presence of biaryl and diaryl ether bonds between some or all of their galloyl units.[1] Among ellagitannins, there exists a subclass of structurally unique nonahydroxyterphenoyl (NHTP)-bearing C-glucosidic molecules featuring an open-chain glucose core and exemplified by the epimers vescalagin and castalagin. The fact that some of these C-glucosidic ellagitannins are found in wine as a result of aging of this beverage in oak-made barrels provided us with the impetus to examine their chemical reactivity and biological activity. Indeed, during aging in oak barrels, the hydroalcoholic and slightly acidic (i.e., pH 3-4) wine solution enables the solid-liquid extraction of these ellagitannins. Once in the wine solution, some of these natural products such as vescalagin can capture grape-derived nucleophilic entities such as the flavanols catechin and epicatechin and the anthocyanin oenin to furnish condensation products, some of them having been postulated as active principles in Asian herbal medicines.[2] Of pharmacological importance is the fact that several of these found-in-wine ellagitannin hybrids are much more potent than etoposide (VP-16) at inhibiting in vitro the anti-cancer target DNA topoisomerase IIa.[2a,b] Furthermore, we recently discovered that vescalagin is capable of drastically perturbing the actin cytoskeleton by interacting selectively with the actin filaments, both in vitro and in cellulo.[3] Moreover, gallotannins, in which galloyl units and/or depsidically-linked chains of galloyl units are usually esterified to a glucopyranose core, and some of their simpler precursors exhibit some interesting properties with possible applications as antifibrillogenic agents. The various biophysico-chemical properties we unveiled for these hydrolysable tannin representatives, as well as the results of our efforts toward their chemical total synthesis,[4] will be presented during this lecture.

Recently, evidences showed that some viruses are able to modify the alternative splicing (AS) of few host genes. Since AS has an important regulatory role, we hypothesized that these changes in AS could be more important. To study virus-driven modifications of the AS landscape of host cell, mock and reovirus-infected L929 cells were analyzed by high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize changes on cellular AS during viral infection. We determined that 240 alternative splicing events (ASEs) were significantly modified during reovirus infection (Q<0.05). These 240 events affect genes enriched in RNA processing and maturation pathways, such as RNA splicing. Then, we investigated what could cause these changes. First, we looked at splicing factors expression during the course of infection. ESRP1 was overexpressed 40 times in infected cells compared to control ones. A bystander experiments showed that ESRP1 overexpression does not require reovirus presence, since it is also overexpressed in cells exposed to only soluble antiviral factors secreted during infection. Our results demonstrate that the host-cell RNA splicing landscape is modified upon reovirus infection, and that this modulation could be induced by antiviral response triggered by viral infection. *Lopes, A.A.(1); English, A.(2) (1) Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Concordia University Heme proteins are important for many biological process such as cell respiration, transcription, and antioxidant defense. Heme is synthesized in an eight-step process that finalizes with the insertion of ferrous ion (Fe2+) into the porphyrin. This reaction is catalyzed by ferrochelatase (FECH), but no heme acceptor that interacts directly or indirectly with FECH has yet been described. Interestingly, cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1) is a heme protein that is synthesized in fermenting yeast before heme accumulation. Thus, apoCcp1 may be a heme acceptor of FECH, but these proteins appear to be localized on different sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Pet9, a highly abundant ATP/ADP transporter in the inner membrane has additionally been characterized as a heme transporter and was found to be both a Ccp1 and FECH interactor in pulldown studies. My aim is to characterize in detail the interaction between Ccp1, Pet9 and FECH and, as a starting point, I optimized expression of GST-apoCcp1 and of the GST control in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. I added purified recombinant GST-apoCcp1 as bait or GST as a control to lysates of the mitochondrial-enriched (P10) fraction from 1-day BY4741 yeast cells. To solubilize the inner membrane, 20 mM N-octylglucoside was also added to the P10 lysates. Pet9 and mitochondrial matrix proteins such as aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase were detected in the GST-apoCcp1 pulldowns, which confirms successful solubilization of the membrane. Nevertheless, extensive cleavage of GST-apoCcp1 in the P10 lysates was detected by SDS-PAGE with silver staining. Fresh PMSF, a serine protease inhibitor, was added to P10 fractions to prevent cleavage of GST-apoCcp1, which reduces the sensitivity of pulldown assays. This and other strategies to optimize pulldown assays will be discussed. *Rahman, M. S. (1) (1) Concordia University The enzyme tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (tRNA-NT) is involved in adding cytosine-cytosine-adenine (CCA) to the 3  end of eukaryotic tRNAs during their maturation, which is required for aminoacylation and protein synthesis. In yeast, this enzyme is defined as a Class II tRNA-NT due to the presence of multiple conserved N-terminal Motifs. Based on available crystal structures of related tRNA-NTs, specific functions have been defined to these motifs. One goal of this project is to better understand the role of Motif C, the least well characterized motif, in enzyme structure and function. Studying tRNA-NT variants containing amino acid substitutions at E189 and D190 in Motif C, shows reduced enzyme activity. Another goal is to understand how an alteration in Motif A (at R64) restores enzyme activity in those low-activity variants of Motif C. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopic analyses suggest no major changes in structure in the variants suggesting that changes caused by the substitutions act locally. Thermal stability is affected in some variants. Kinetic analyses showed no alterations in substrate binding (Km) for ATP, CTP or tRNA, but a reduction in turnover number (kcat) for the 189 and 190 variants, and an increase in kcat in the position 64 double variants. These data suggest that Motif C may play a role in accommodating and orienting the substrates to promote catalysis. Proteolysis experiments using chymotrypsin suggest a reorientation of residues in the R64W variants hinting that this variant causes a change in organization at Motif A that in turn increases catalytic efficiency. *Sakeer, K.

(1) (1) Universit  du Qu bec   Montr al (UQAM) The novel Ampholytic CarboxyMethyl-AminoEthyl-starch (CM-AE-St) polymer was synthesized first by starch treatment with sodium monochloroacetate to obtain CM-St and then by treatment with 2-chloroethylamine hydrochloride in order to introduce AminoEthyl (AE) groups. The CM-AE-St was characterized by physical methods, FT-IR, 1H NMR, SEM, TG, X-ray diffraction and by in vitro drug dissolution. Higher DS for both CM- and AE- groups favor the ability of ampholytic CM-AE-St to control the drugs release of high soluble drugs such as Metformin followed in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). For instance, monolithic tablets with CM-AE-St (DS 0.06 for CM and 0.059 for AE groups) and with metformin loading 50% similar shape and weight to the commercial Glumetza , were able to prolong liberation of active drugs up to 10h, exhibiting a similar dissolution profile to that of commercial product. The presence of both (cationic and anionic) functional groups generates a self-stabilized polymer with improved ability to control the drug delivery. The release profiles show a good fit to Higuchi s model (r2 > 0.99). The release pattern obtained with the ampholytic starch excipient seems to be in good agreement with the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) requirements for metformin controlled release tablets. *Tchoumi Ner e, A.

In Canada, up to 15% of the population suffer from IBD. The therapies available are mostly based on corticosteroids and on non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) know to present various undesirable side effects. Diamine oxidase (DAO) is a protein extracted from lentil seedlings. It oxidizes primary biogenic amines (i.e. putrescine and histamine) producing the corresponding aldehydes, NH4+ and H2O2. Histamine is a mediator of anaphylactic reactions and a proinflammatory factors. The disequilibrium between the accumulated histamine and the capacity for DAO to generate allergic phenomena and a harmful effect on subjects suffering of IBD. The aim of this project is to characterize the diamine oxydase (DAO) formulated with gastro-resistant excipients for an oral administration to reinforce the endogenous intestinal DAO. A special attention was to characterize the biological impact of the biliary acids on DAO activity. The spectrophotometry, fluorimetry and circular dichro sme analysis revealed that the cholic acid or deoxycholic acid protect enzyme and prevent the loss of its activity in presence of 0.1M of NaHCO3 or NaOH. This study shows that cholic and deoxycholic acid may play an important function in maintain DAO activity. *Yasmina, N.

SCD1 was shown to be expressed and required for the survival and proliferation of many carcinomas. In the studies reported here, we investigated the role of SCD1 in the proliferation of the human T lymphocytic leukemia Jurkat cell line and human peripheral T cells. T cell receptor stimulation of T cells significantly induced SCD1 expression. SCD1 knockdown and activity inhibition modulated the cellular fatty acid profiles with a significant decrease in the monounsaturated fatty acids 16:1n-7 and 18:1n-7, but not oleic acid 18:1n-9. SCD1 inhibition had no effect on cellular proliferation assessed by flow cytometry analysis following CFSE incorporation, however it induced apoptosis in T cells but not Jurkat cells. We measured cellular SCD5 presence by Western analysis and its expression could be the compensating delta-9 desaturase element responsible for the maintenance of cellular 18:1n-9 and proliferation capacity. Silencing or inhibition of both SCD1 and SCD5 isoforms could therefore be a therapeutic strategy for proliferative diseases. Posters *Ali, M. (1) (1) Concordia University Bacterial secondary metabolites represent an important source of antimicrobial agents that could greatly help in human s battle against pathogens. For example, previous studies indicate that gram-negative bacteria Photorhabdus luminescens produce a number of antibiotics. However, secondary metabolites are highly regulated in bacteria, which leads to difficulties in extraction and isolation. A plausible approach to overcome tight regulation could be to introduce of additional copies of transcription initiation factors or/and enhancer binding proteins. This could potentially upregulate DNA transcription of secondary metabolite gene cluster. Hence, s-54 transcription initiation factor and a constitutively active form of enhancer binding protein DctD were independently used to transform P. luminescens via plasmids. Firstly, P. luminescens transformed with s-54 gene, rpoN, showed no phenotypic difference to wild type. On the other hand, DctD transformation displayed a new product with blue glow under long wave UV light. Further on, LC/MS and tandem MS studies of DctD-positive cell extract show the formation of new compounds and a reduction in the production of others. HPLC-UV-Vis provided UV data corresponding to MS peaks of interest. Future work will be to grow large quantities of DctD-positive P. luminescens, test for antimicrobial activity, and obtain structures via 2D-NMR and/or crystallography. *Allaire, A. (1); Boivin, G.

Its primary infection in newborns and its reactivation in immunocompromised individuals are associated with many cases of mortality and morbidity. Several antiviral resistant strains are found in some infected patients. These strains have mutations in the viral gene encoding the HCMV DNA polymerase UL54. The research hypothesis is that these mutations affect the binding of antivirals to UL54, thus rendering them ineffective against the virus. This research aims to elucidate the antiviral resistance molecular mechanism of this pathogen. Until now, expression and purification of recombinant wild type (WT) and mutant UL54 proteins were performed. By spectrofluorimetry, it was possible to observe that the affinity of WT and mutant UL54 proteins is similar for ssDNA. However, the mutants  affinity for dATP is different compared to the affinity of WT UL54 for this nucleotide. Preliminary results of the antiviral Foscarnet interaction to various forms of UL54 were also obtained by spectrofluorimetry. These suggest that the mutants UL54 associated with resistance weakly bind or don t bind the antiviral as efficiently as the WT protein. Changes of the nucleotide and antiviral interaction with UL54 seem to be implicated in the molecular mechanism of resistance. *Brand, C. (1); Votaw, K. (2); McCullagh, M. (2); Geiss, B.

Other members of this genus include Dengue virus and Zika virus. Flaviviruses are infecting millions of people and causing tens of thousands of deaths every year. Despite research efforts to find inhibitors targeting the active sites of viral enzymes, there are no antiviral treatments available. Here we characterize the interaction between the two flaviviral proteins NS3 and NS5 that play key roles in the replication complex in the prospect of identifying a new drug target. An interaction model between NS3, NS5 and viral RNA was developed by manual docking, and then subjected to molecular dynamics simulations. Residues involved in potential interactions between NS3 and NS5 were identified and mutated. The effects of the different mutations on viral replication as well as on protein-protein interaction were measured. One particular region on the surface of the NS3 protein was identified to play an important role in viral replication. A virtual screening for compounds that can bind this region will be performed, and the ability of these compounds to interfere with the replication complex formation and thus viral replication will be evaluated. *Ducharme, J. (1); Auclair, K. (2) (1) McGill University Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) consist of a large family of hemoproteins catalyzing oxidation reactions that are essential to the biosynthesis of endogenous substances (steroids, lipids, vitamins). They include some of the most important enzymes involved in drug and xenobiotic metabolism. The action of CYPs is also one of the most important causes of drug-drug interactions. Finally they are implicated in drug resistance and xenobiotic toxicity. Human CYP3A4 alone is involved in the metabolism of ~50% of all drugs in the clinics. Interestingly, this enzyme displays cooperative behaviour, attributed in part to its large and flexible active site, which has been shown to simultaneously bind multiple copies of the same and different ligands at once. To get a better understanding of this particularity of CYP3A4, we propose a way to covalently attach various ligand molecules in the enzyme binding-site and investigate the impact on catalytic efficiency and cooperativity. This will help isolate the effect of the different ligands bound and give insight on how each of them impacts the overall activity of CYP3A4. Such information will help understand drug metabolism better and contribute to our general knowledge of this new mechanism of cooperativity. *Fortinez, C. (1); Bloudoff, K. (1); Schmeing, M. (1) (1) McGill University Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are large multimodular mega-enzymes that catalyze peptide bonds resulting in the formation of biologically interesting compounds such as bleomycin (anti-tumor). Each module contains three integral domains including the adenylation domain (A) which transports the substrate to the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) arm. The PCP domain of the current module and the PCP arm of the previous module will transport their covalently bound substrates to the condensation (C) domain where the peptide bond is catalyzed. The growing peptide chain will eventually be transported to the C domain of the next module where elongation continues. The C domain is sometimes replaced with a cyclization (Cy) domain in non-canonical NRPSs. They are responsible for two reactions. The first involves the formation of a peptide bond. The latter involves forming 5-membered heterocyclic rings with cysteine, threonine and serine side chains resulting in oxazole and thiazole ring formation found in anti-tumor compounds such as epothilone. The function of the Cy domain has not been fully elucidated. However, NRPSs are great in that rearranging different modules can produce novel therapeutic products. Insufficient knowledge of the C and the Cy domain has lead to efforts that result in low product yields. The hope is to do structural and biochemical experiments with the Cy domain to better understand its function. *Ghilarducci, K. (1); Djerir, B. (1); Desroches, C. (1); Arteau,, J. (1); Bourgault; S.

In fact, whereas recent studies have highlighted the function of enzymes constituting the ubiquitin (UB) system in various cellular system, our understanding of the universal UB enzymatic machinery that govern protein degradation, activity and localization remains exceptionally limited. In this context, we are eager to expose fundamental molecular properties of RNF167, an enzyme of the UB system for which the molecular characteristics and intrinsic properties are exceptionally limited. Therefore, our objective is to identify and characterize UB-conjugating enzymes (UBE2) functionally interacting with RNF167. After optimizing the expression and purification procedure, we developed an in-vitro ubiquitination assay to determine which UBE2 functionally pair with purified RNF167. We show that RNF167 is functionally pairing with nine of the twenty-nine UBE2 tested. Also, we demonstrate the physical interaction between RNF167 and UBE2D1 via GST-pulldown. Finally, our Surface Plasmon Resonance experiment shows that the dissociation rate of UBE2D1/RNF167 is instantaneous and this is consistent with dissociation rate observed in the literature between UBE2s interacting with other UB ligases. Taken together, our results reveal functional interactions between RNF167 and UBE2s. Semana, P. - A novel gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase from Aspergillus niger: functional characterization and identification of residues critical for activity *Semana, P. (1); Powlowski, J. (1,2) (1) Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Concordia University, Montreal, QC (2) Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics, Concordia University, Montreal, QC Ring-cleavage dioxygenases catalyze the critical oxygen-dependent ring-opening reaction in the metabolism of aromatic compounds by bacteria and fungi. While ring-cleavage dioxygenases of bacterial origin have been relatively well-studied, fungal enzymes from this group of enzymes are poorly characterized. Here, we report the functional characterization and identification of residues critical for activity of a novel gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (GDO) from Aspergillus niger. Using a structural superposition of a homology-based model for the fungal enzyme, and the bacterial GDO template structures, we identified residues potentially involved in catalysis and/or substrate binding based on their positions relative to the bound substrate. We then generated and purified C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged variant proteins of A. niger-GDO, with residues Gln-92, His-150 and Asp-162 substituted by alanine, and residue Leu-166 by Ile. We found that, while single substitution variants H150A and D162A are not catalytically active, they are still able to bind gentisate as shown by a fluorescence-based ligand-binding assay. This loss of catalytic activity is not due to altered structural integrity of the variant proteins, as shown by circular dichroism and fluorescence emission spectra similar to the wild type. Furthermore, based on the observed kinetic parameters, we propose that residue Gln-92 is involved in catalysis but probably not in the initial binding of the substrate since its kcat value is 30-fold lower that of the wild type, with a Km for gentisate not significantly changed. Moreover, L166I had kinetic properties similar to the wild type enzyme indicating that the side chain of isoleucine can function equally well for that of leucine s in substrate binding and catalysis. This work will serve as basis for further understanding the structure and activity relationships in gentisate 1,2-dioxygenases.

This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract Polylactide (PLA)-based nanomaterials have been extensively explored in biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, PLA has two main limitations: hydrophobicity and slow degradation rate. My Ph.D. research focuses on the exploration of potential approaches to circumvent these challenges by synthesis of PLA-based amphiphilic block copolymers (ABPs) with stimuli-responsive degradation (SRD) and these ABPs are used to fabricate novel PLA-based nanomaterials. SRD is highly desirable in the design of multi-functional polymer-based drug delivery systems. SRD involves the incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds into nanomaterials that can be cleaved in response to external stimuli such as light, ultrasound, low pH, and enzymes. This process leads to chemical or physical changes of nanomaterials to enhance the release of therapeutics or tune the morphologies. Reduction-responsive degradation uses disulfide-thiol chemistry. Disulfide linkages are cleaved either in response to a reductive environment or a disulfide-thiol exchange reaction in the presence of thiols. Using this unique system, PLA-based nanomaterials with disulfide linkages can be developed for tumor-targeting drug delivery. Amphiphilic micellar aggregates have attracted much interest as a promising candidate for effective polymeric drug delivery. Micelles are formed through aqueous self-assembly of ABPs consisting of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks. Hydrophobic cores encapsulate hydrophobic therapeutics and the surrounding hydrophilic coronas enhance colloidal stability. Adjusting this unique structure of ABP is a promising strategy for circumventing the hydrophobicity of PLA. Uniformed micelles in the nanoscale size range can prolong the blood residence and minimize side effects, and possess multiple cargos into a single vehicle, allowing multi-functional drug delivery. In this thesis, several reduction-responsive degradable PLA-based ABPs have been reported. They were further used to fabricate various nanomaterials including micellar drug carriers; polyplexes; and nanofibers. These ABPs were synthesized by a combination method of ring opening polymerization and atom transfer radical polymerization. Due to their amphiphilic nature, ABPs can be self-assembled to form the micellar platforms possessing hydrophobic therapeutics in the core, which is surrounded with hydrophilic coronas. ABPs with positively charged hydrophilic blocks enable the formation of cationic micellar aggregates. These cationic micelles have subsequently been used as dual delivery carriers of drugs and genes. Furthermore, incorporating dual-located disulfide linkages at both the hydrophobic PLA core and the interface leads to a synergistically enhanced release of encapsulated drugs in cellular environments. Moreover, PLA nanofibers were fabricated via air-spinning technique of high-molecular weight PLAs. Their hydrophobic surface was modified with hydrophilic polymers via facile surface-initiated ATRP. The resulting surface-modified PLA fibers exhibit enhanced hydrophilicity and thermal stability, as well as tunable surface properties upon the cleavage of disulfide linkages. Under a reductive environment, these novel PLA-based nanomaterials are rapidly degraded upon the cleavage of disulfides, leading to controlled release of drugs and genes, as well as change of surface properties. These results suggest the disulfide-labeled PLA-based nanomaterials offer great potential and versatility in biomedical applications. Where Room 265.29, Richard J.

Presented here are two synthetic models (cryptands LTEA and LTTA), that are inspired by the second-coordination sphere features of such enzymes. The reactivity of copper(II)- and iron(III)-hydroperoxo species were studied as they are key intermediates proposed in the catalytic cycles of C-H bond hydroxylation performed by oxygenase enzymes. Ultimately, this work was developed to further our understanding of oxygenation reactions by guiding the reactivity of copper(II)- and iron(III)-hydroperoxo intermediates with second coordination sphere features. The structure and reactivity of copper(II) complexes of LTEA was influenced by the second coordination sphere. Reaction of the complexes with basic hydrogen peroxide in methanol led to the formation of copper(II)-hydroperoxo intermediates. The mechanism of the reaction was studied by low-temperature mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance and stopped-flow ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. Both the starting complexes and intermediates were constrained by the cryptand to square-based geometries. The decomposition of the intermediates via self-oxidation was probed by deuterating select positions on the cryptand. A small kinetic isotope effect of 1.5, in conjunction with the analysis of the demetallated organic products, points to a direct oxygen-atom transfer to a tertiary amine on the cryptand, forming an N-oxide. A novel cryptand, LTTA, was designed and synthesized in high-yields and was shown to be ditopic through X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. The reaction of iron(II)-triflate complexes of LTTA with hydrogen peroxide or iodosylbenzene led to an intramolecular aromatic C-H bond hydroxylation, to afford an iron(III)-phenolate species, which was characterized by mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance and stopped-flow ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. The kinetic analysis from the reaction of the iron(II) complex with hydrogen peroxide led to the identification of an iron(III)-hydroperoxo intermediate, formed prior to the iron(III)-phenolate. The iron(III)-hydroperoxo is proposed to first undergo heterolytic cleavage to form a high-valent Fe(V)-oxo-hydroxo, a mechanism comparable to C-H bond activation in Rieske dioxygenases.

In biological systems the copper containing enzyme tyrosinase catalyzes the ortho-oxygenation of tyrosine into L-dopaquinone in the first step of the melanogenesis process. The copper centres in the enzyme activate O2 hrough the formation of  - 2: 2-peroxodicopper(II) (SP) and subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution on tyrosine provides L-dopaquinone. Despite many efforts for the past 50 years to develop a synthetic mimic for the aerobic oxygenation of phenols a truly catalytic system for the selective ortho-oxygenation of phenols was only recently reported. The copper(I) complex of N,N -di-tert-butylethylenediamine (DBED) is used as the precatalyst that activates oxygen and catalyzes the ortho-oxygenation of phenols. Investigating the mechanism of this catalytic process is the first objective of this research whereby spectroscopic techniques are used to identify intermediates in this reaction and perform kinetic studies. The second objective of the research is the development of analogous phenol ortho-amination using nitrosoarenes as substitutes for oxygen. The mechanistic studies were performed by spectroscopic characterization of intermediates and comparison with independently prepared complexes or literature spectra. In situ UV-vis spectroscopy of the reaction at 25  C demonstrated the formation of a copper(II)-semiquinone complex that persists during the oxygenation process. In order to identify the preceding intermediates, low temperature UV-vis spectroscopy was used and the intermediates were characterized spectroscopically through comparison with similarly reported species. Based on the observed intermediates a mechanism is proposed whereby the copper complex activates oxygen to forming SP; an oxygen atom is then transferred to a bound phenolate through electrophilic aromatic substitution. Kinetic studies using low-temperature stopped-flow techniques proved the binuclear mechanism of O2 activation and no dependence on phenol. The mechanistic investigation suggests that oxygen activation and phenol functionalization proceed through the same pathway as the one observed with tyrosinase thus proving the bio-mimetic nature of this catalytic reaction. Nitrosoarenes (ArNO) are isoelectronic with singlet oxygen, therefore copper(I)/ArNO complexes are structural and electronic mimics of Cu/O2 complexes and are expected to react in a iv similar way with external substrates. The redox lability of nitrosoarenes was proved by preparing and characterizing a copper(II)-nitrosoarene radical-anion complex. Structural and computational investigation confirmed its similarity to end-on copper(II)-superoxo species. The two-electron reduction of nitrosoarene was performed using the copper(I) complex of diamine ligand and forms a side-on copper(II)-peroxo (SP) mimic. This complex undergoes stoichiometric reaction with phenolates to form aminophenols after reductive work-up, thus demonstrating similar reactivity to tyrosinase models. Where Room 265.29, Richard J.

Notwithstanding this success, the approved liposome formulations largely result in improvements in the toxicity profile of drug with limited to no enhancements in efficacy.  In addition, a number of drugs relying on formulation in liposomes have failed in clinical development.  The many pre-clinical and clinical studies that have been conducted on liposomes have revealed a number of limitations associated with this technology.  These include variability in tumor accumulation due to clinical heterogeneity in the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect as well as poor tumor penetration, and in some cases, limited drug release once at the tumor site.  Thermosensitive liposomes have the potential to address these issues, in particular, when they are designed to provide largely intravascular release of drug within the tumor region.  Our laboratory has designed a thermosensitive liposome formulation of cisplatin that provides triggered drug release in response to temperatures in the mild hyperthermia range.  This presentation will review our data obtained to date with this formulation in combination with mild hyperthermia in a series of tumor xenograft models of human cervical, lung and breast cancers.  The factors that impact the effect of this therapeutic strategy will be discussed including tumor microenvironment parameters such as microvessel density, degree of hypoxia, stromal content, cell sensitivity to drug and heat shock protein expression.

This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract This thesis presents an alternative approach to modeling economic growth by constructing a biosphere-energy-technology (BET) model that incorporates energy, technology and entropy as distinct factors that generate transitional competitive equilibriums. The BET model assumes that technological progress is limited by recognized and available energy sources/carriers, named general purpose energy sources (GPESs), and that the recognition of such sources affect choices in technological development. It is the first economic growth model to incorporate the biosphere as a complex dissipative structure, which can experience catastrophic bifurcations. The BET model, which puts strict conditions on the idea that no innovative society need accept Malthusian diminishing returns, predicts that energy and technology are both required for sustained growth given some temporal relationship between them. The main findings from the BET model are that pervasive technology shocks lead to large increases in consumption, but that technology alone will not sustain economic growth; and, that energy shocks cause permanent labour resource movements from the consumption sector to the energy knowledge sector. Energy shocks in the BET model result in an increase in consumption and utility; however, the effect of a particular energy source that gives rise to the energy shock depends on various parameters that embody institutional factors and policy. Using hydrogen as a GPES candidate that can give rise to an energy shock, the effects of deuterated molecular hydrogen and deuterated methane on the kinetic rate constants for selected stratospheric radical reactions, including the rate of ozone destruction, were examined computationally. In the case of a tethered hydrogen economy, an increase in deuterated molecular hydrogen in the stratosphere may result in a marked change in the rate at which chlorine radical acts as a sink for H2 and can contribute to decreasing ozone concentrations. However, the kinetic isotope effect results for methane oxidation reactions imply that decreases in polar stratospheric clouds formation and decreased solid HCl are possible with a tethered hydrogen economy resulting in less ozone destruction. In sum, monodeuterated molecular hydrogen and methane may not contribute to appreciable stratospheric ozone loss and may even have a net positive effect. Where Room 1001.01, Henry F.

Abstract The stress response to exogenous H2O2 has provided significant insight into thiol-based cytosolic H2O2 sensors such as OxyR in E. coli and its eukaryotic counterpart Gpx3/Yap1 in S. cerevisiae. However, sensing of endogenously generated H2O2 in mitochondria, the main sites of H2O2 production in respiring yeast, is poorly documented. We have recently demonstrated that cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1) acts as a mitochondrial H2O2 sensor to balance ROS levels by regulating catalase A activity and attenuating the H2O2 stress response during aging. Since Ccp1 is the first heme-based H2O2 sensor to be identified, its mechanism of action at the molecular level is of much interest. This thesis reports on how H2O2 signals through Ccp1. Activity assays reveal the accumulation of catalytically inactive and heme-free Ccp1 outside mitochondria in respiring cells, when catalase activity starts to increase. Importantly, the burst in H2O2 generation during the switch from fermentation to respiration triggers heme-mediated oxidation by H2O2 of the proximal Fe ligand, H175. Formation of oxo-H175 weakens the heme-ligand interaction and labilizes the heme group, which is transferred either directly or via unidentified intermediate(s) to apoCta1. The nascent Cta1 activity detoxifies H2O2 and apoCcp1 which has conformational lability undergoes reverse translocation to the vacuole and nucleus. Mass spectrometric characterization of heme-mediated H2O2-induced chemical and posttranslational modifications in recombinant Ccp1 and Ccp1 isolated from yeast cells, respectively, has allowed us to identify the residues oxidized as well as to evaluate radical-transfer pathways in Ccp1 in response to both exogenous and endogenous H2O2. Importantly, the mass spectrometry-based approach described here provides a way to fully evaluate the oxidation profile of a protein. . Although Cta1 was not found as a binding partner of GST-Ccp1 in GST pull-down assays, the antioxidant proteins, manganese superoxide dismutase (Sod2), thioredoxin peroxidase (Tsa1), the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the putative heme transporter Pet9 and heat shock proteins 70 and 90 were reproducibly found as Ccp1 binding partners. Combined, the results presented provide insights into the mechanism of H2O2 signaling in cells involving heme-mediated redox changes in contrast to the redox chemistry of thiols.

These protein misfolding disorders differ on the identity and nature of the protein that misassembles into aggregates, including those with a cross- -sheet amyloid structure. Substantial evidence supports the amyloid hypothesis, i.e. that a multi-step process of protein aggregation causes cellular and tissue degeneration. Nonetheless, critical issues regarding the (bio)chemical mechanisms underlying these diseases remain unknown, counteracting the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. For instance, it is not understood why a given protein forms amyloid fibrils in a particular tissue and by which pathways it misfolds into insoluble aggregates. Our group is studying the molecular basis of peptide and protein self-assembly in the context of their interactions with biological factors, including glycosaminoglycans and lipid bilayers. We are focusing on the mechanisms of amyloid formation of two polypeptide precursors; the intrinsically disordered peptidic hormone islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), whose aggregation is associated with DM-2, and the variable domain of the immunoglobulin light chain. By means of a combination of (bio)chemical and biophysical approaches, we are probing the roles of structural conversion in the pathway(s) by which these polypeptides self-assemble and trigger cell degeneration.  Steve Bourgault received his Ph.D. in biology from the INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier and the Universit  de Rouen (joint doctoral thesis) in 2009.

Our on-going research collaborations with colleagues world-wide emphasize structural determinants of membrane proteins that are required for transport, including solving their 3-D structures by X-ray crystallography. For import of iron-siderophore complexes, seven proteins in the cell envelope of Escherichia coli are essential. We use FhuA from E. coli as a model bacterial outer MP. TonB, partner protein of FhuA, is one of three proteins from the energy-transducing complex TonB ExbB ExbD that is embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane. Initial studies of the TonB interactome began with our X-ray structure 2GRX for the co-crystal of TonB FhuA. We recently adopted complementary strategies to generate models for the 3-D organization of the TonB interactome. When we fully understand the structure and function of TonB, ExbB, and ExbD, then we will know a critical mechanism whereby Gram-negative bacteria acquire iron. Knowledge advanced by outcomes from our research will enable the design of antibacterial compounds that block iron import, thus markedly slowing bacterial growth. Dr Coulton did his undergraduate work at UofT, a Master s degree at Calgary and a Ph.D. at Western. All three degrees were in biology-like departments. He published his first paper in about 1973.

Current biological and chemical approaches being taken to utilize biomass are limited by the difficulty in processing biomass and the energy needed for separation of the components. New and efficient solvents and process technologies are needed to help unlock the promise of biomass. These new technologies could provide new market opportunities for medical, forestry, agricultural, and fishing industries as we move toward a more sustainable biomass-based economy. With a plethora of abundant natural and renewable resources (in terms of both quantity and diversity), from water purification - to cosmetics - to medical applications, the quality of human life can greatly benefit (and improve at the same time) from new, innovative biomass-related technologies. With this mission in mind, we are exploring the entire range of the  biorefinery concept,  from dissolution, and conversion of biomass into value added chemicals and extraction of essential oils or vital chemicals from raw biomass sources,[1] to isolation of pure biopolymers and production of new biomaterials from them.[2] Because we can directly dissolve Nature s biopolymers, we can shape them, functionalize them, blend them, and use other noncovalent means to produce advanced functional materials.

Protein synthesis is a complex and conserved process, targeted by many antimicrobials. The mapping of genetic interactions between virtually all known or predicted translation-related genes of Escherichia coli in four conditions allowed to draw conclusions about the rewiring of genetic interactions in environmental adaptation and evolution. Furthermore, we were able to identify and independently verify functionally central and previously uncharacterized genes required for normal translation. The combination of genetic interaction and proteomics approaches further elucidated the role of one of these genes in ribosome biogenesis. Similarly, a combination of genomic and proteomic approaches is being used to examine bacterial host subversion mechanisms.

Concordia professor and Acfas presenter Ann English:  Understanding how cells age at the molecular level would have a huge impact on society.  | Photo by David Ward At this spring s 82nd congress of the Association francophone pour le savoir (Acfas) from May 12 to 16, which will see a convergence of more than 5,000 researchers at Concordia, English is co-hosting a symposium that explores the analytical technique s many applications. Her interest in mass spectrometry dates to her days as a PhD candidate in chemistry at McGill.  There was a big revolution in mass spectrometry around the late 1980s, when the instrumentation became suitable for use with larger biological molecules.  The availability of super-sensitive instruments has made it a lot easier to find out what free metal ions like iron and copper do to the proteins they come in contact with in cells. Researchers are now able to quantify changes in protein mass and chemical composition, and that, English says, may have major real-world implications.  We re very interested in how the proteins are modified in cells, particularly due to metal-induced oxidation, oxidative stress and aging. In more recent years, we ve begun to get a really good picture of how proteins are modified with age.  English and her colleagues are probing how the aging process could alter brain cells   and slow them down. As certain proteins aggregate, clumps begin to form, leading neural cells to become less functional.  We think that s triggered by chemical modification,  she says.  This occurs slowly, over time, and can lead to neurodegeneration.  And although they re working at what English calls a very basic level, the research they re producing could change the way we treat diseases like Alzheimer s, Huntington s and Parkinson s.  Understanding how cells age at the chemical level and understanding what interventions might be possible would have a huge impact on society.  For now, English works with baker s yeast and red blood cells. She has moved from looking at molecules in a test tube to examining them in the cellular environment.  My group has been floored by what we see,  she says. The switch has proven transformative, and the discovery process continues to amaze her. English says enzymes that seem to have a single function in a test tube perform five of more different tasks in a cellular environment.  My students are just awed.

A culture of innovation Right now, the research group is exploring new ways to use lanthanide-doped nanoparticles for bioimaging, and as a detection tool for targeting cancer cells. That sort of innovation has long been part of Capobianco s work.  We were the first to observe upconversion in nanoparticles in the late 1990s,  he says. These upconverting nanoparticles, which can be synthesized in the lab, render near-infrared light visible.  With that, we started looking at using some of the potential applications of upconversion with lanthanides, and it s just rolled along since.  Jessica Yu, a master s student, has been experimenting with the use of upconverting nanoparticles in photodynamic therapy   an effort that could one day yield groundbreaking results.  The more I do this research, the more I realize that this is something that can help people,  she says.  It really could have a significant impact on the world.  The current crop of lanthanide researchers are among the best students Capobianco has ever had.  They re not just doing very interesting science,  he says.  They re also giving back to society.    Meet the Lanthanide Research Group The members of the Lanthanide Research Group are pursuing a wide range of projects. Here s a taste of what they re working on   and what they hope to achieve. PhD student Diana Consuelo Rodr guez Burbano is looking at the use of electron-trapping nanoparticles, also known as nanophosphors, to identify and target cancer cells. This kind of treatment allows for deeper tissue penetration than typical UV technology, but with less tissue damage. Master s student Jessica Yu is experimenting with using upconverting nanoparticles in photodynamic cancer treatments. The goal, she says, is to get deep in the body to target the most cancer cells possible. Paola Andrea Rojas Guti rrez, a PhD student who received both a Concordia International Tuition Fee Remission Award and a privately funded scholarship from her native Colombia, is looking at new ways to use nanoparticles as a drug-delivery system. Ying Li, another master s student, is examining the use of nanoparticles as a bimodal imaging contrasting agent, which would allow them to be seen both optically and through the use of magnetic resonance imaging. Visiting PhD student Malgorzata Misiak is working on a research collaboration between Concordia and her home institution, Poland s University of Wroc aw in Poland. She is also looking at a specific application of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles in photodynamic therapy to treat cancer. PhD candidate Ana Maria Ibarra Ruiz, a new student, who received both the Frederick Lowy Scholars Fellowship and an Arts and Science Graduate Fellowship, is still working out the direction of her research project. She previously worked with lanthanides in Colombia.  The research that I did there wasn t as applied, though. I find this research a lot more interesting for that reason.  She will be working on using quantum dots and upconverting nanoparticles to construct hybrid luminescent probes. Two undergraduate students, Rebecca Webb and Andrew Dalton, also work in the lab, as does post-doctoral researcher Nicoleta Bogdan, who hails from Romania.  It s a great opportunity for me to work in spectroscopy and luminescence,  she says.  And working with nanoparticles is something that s always interested me.

But while incentive to study is strong, as of 2011, only 18.6 per cent of university graduates aged 25 to 64 had earned their highest degree, certificate or diploma in the subject. Concordia is aiming to help boost those numbers. This summer, it s piquing elementary-school-aged children s interest in science with two interactive outreach initiatives.   Aha moments at the Eureka! Festival The first   the Eureka! Festival   takes place at the Montreal Science Centre, in Montreal s Old Port, from June 13 to 15. At the three-day event hosted by the Science Centre and the Conf rence r gionale des  lus de Montr al, Concordia students, staff and faculty are hosting a range of workshops out of three tent-kiosks. Concordia engineering students have built a number of K NEX structures, including replicas of the Eiffel Tower, Habitat 67 and a space shuttle. Photo by Concordia University The subject matter ranges from physics and chemistry to engineering, but visitors won t be treated to any conventional classroom lectures.  Science is cool,  says Miriam Posner, technical supervisor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.  We want to get kids interested in it at a very young age.  To that end, Posner herself is introducing visitors to printing and paper-making in the Physics and Chemistry tent.  We ll be using recycled fibers, and the kids will get to make actual paper.  A team from  Concordia s chapter of the educational outreach organisation Let s Talk Science  is sharing a tent with Virtual Touch, which will showcase the  Illimitable Space System , a digital technology that animates human bodies in real time. The system was developed by Miao Song and Serguei Mokhov, affiliate assistant professors and part-time faculty members in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. Meanwhile, at the Concordia-staffed K NEX Labyrinth, children will be able to navigate a maze made from the popular K NEX toy. In all, some 30 university ambassadors will be on hand to show children   many of whom will be bused in by their schools on the Friday   what science is all about.  Audiences can ask questions and interact with the faculty, the staff and the students. They ll be able to engage in scientific discussion at a level that we hope will encourage them to explore the subject matter further.  The return of Westmount Science Camp Many of the same Concordians   including Song and Mokhov, as well as the gang from Let s Talk Science   are also leading workshops for six- to 13-year-olds at the Westmount Science Camp in July and August. The campers, who spend most of the time at Westmount High School, will take part in three field trips to the Loyola Campus.  We re going to be designing all sorts of hands-on experiments for them to watch and participate in,  Posner says.  The idea is to give the campers an interactive approach to learning about basic scientific concepts.

Faculty, students and staff from the Faculty of Arts and Science, the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science and the John Molson School of Business will all play a part in the activities. For the students who lead the experiments, the experience can be a valuable one   especially if they aspire to careers as educators.  They re there to spur childrens  interest in science and technology,  Posner says.  They re there to show them that science is fun and interesting.  The  Eureka!

All the hard work is about to pay off for Concordia s most recent cohort of 1,900 graduates from across the university s four Faculties and the School of Graduate Studies. On Tuesday October 28, they ll receive their well-deserved certificates, diplomas and degrees. This year, the university s fall convocation is being held at Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier in Place des Arts. The ceremonies roll out at 10 a.m. for the Faculty of Arts and Science; at 3 p.m. for the John Molson School of Business; and at 7:30 p.m. for the Faculty of Fine Arts and the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. We asked these five standout students for the secrets to their success. 5 great Concordia grads, in numbers   Governor General s Silver Medal Recipient Faculty of Arts and Science Cojocaru will graduate from Concordia this fall with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Political Science. She began to gravitate toward a career in law and soon discovered a passion for legal studies. Currently, she is a B.C.L./LL.B. (Bachelor of Civil Law/Bachelor of Laws) candidate at McGill University. As a student athlete, Cojocaru exercized her passion for tennis by creating and managing the Concordia University Tennis Team. 3 keys to a good education  Passion   being intellectually driven by one s field of study is essential to having the strength to persevere when the going gets tough.   Harmony   a comfortable balance between school, relationships and extracurricular activities creates a favorable environment for a flourishing education.  Open-mindedness   a learner must welcome, and be stimulated by challenging perspectives.  2 lessons learned at Concordia  There is no universal recipe for success. While people s advice may be useful, ultimately people develop their own personal learning styles.   Professors play an invaluable role in a student s life. They are much more than mere sources of knowledge. They guide us, they provoke us, but most importantly, they inspire us.  1 piece of advice for future grads  Explore! Dare to dive into the unknown.  Isar Kiani Valedictorian John Molson School of Business Kiani s PhD research at Concordia focused on processes and agents that facilitate the diffusion of market information. She is currently working as an assistant professor of marketing at Lawrence Technological University, Michigan, where she teaches graduate and undergraduate courses. Her research has grown to include the study of environmental activist groups and how their activities influences consumer attitudes. 3 keys to a good education  Commitment to a vision. The PhD experience is a complex journey with many twists and turns that could easily derail. To succeed, you must never lose sight of the ultimate objective.   Flexibility. While commitment to the vision is critical, the successful PhD student possesses a curious mind and stays flexible to experience a more fruitful journey.   Opportunism in learning. There is so much to learn as a graduate student and being a student gives you the perfect excuse to express your curiosity!  2 lessons learned at Concordia  There are many different lenses that can be applied to observe the same phenomenon. At Concordia, I found a great opportunity to benefit from sitting in classes from various disciplines and to understand how not just one, but many theoretical perspectives could exist in parallel.   I learned that everyone has something you can learn from. One s apparent limitation is never a good excuse for dismissal of other capabilities. At Concordia, I learned that you should always meet others with an open mind to learn because your refusal to do so means that you have lost an opportunity. 1 piece of advice for future grads  More important than the diploma you receive is the experience you gain along the way. Try to ensure that this experience is one you stay fond of for the remainder of your life.  Amir Ajorlou Governor General s Gold Medal: Technology, Industry and the Environment Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science Ajorlou, a two-time gold medal winner of International Mathematical Olympiad and a winner of the NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship, obtained his PhD from Concordia University with a focus on distributed control of multi-agent systems.  He is a postdoctoral research fellow at University of Pennsylvania and currently a visiting postdoc at MIT, working on social and economic networks. 3 keys to a good education  Have a forward-looking plan. You should have a clear vision about your goals, talents, available opportunities, then plan accordingly.   Seek out a knowledgeable and supportive advisor. I was honored to have one such advisor at Concordia, Prof. Amir G. Aghdam.   Collaborate with other researchers. I enjoyed fruitful collaborative research with Stephane Blouine from Defence Research and Development Canada during my PhD.    2 lessons learned at Concordia  Never lose hope when working on a problem. If you find the door closed, try the window!   Get inspirations from daily life to come up with research ideas. Observe, model and analyze what you find interesting.  1 piece of advice for graduates  Before you start a path, look ahead as far as you can. Imagine yourself reaching the goal and see how satisfied will you be with what you achieve.  Karine Lalonde Valedictorian Faculty of Arts and Science Karine Lalonde s PhD research in environmental sciences focused on studying organic matter in sediments and water systems. She now has a new job as a research associate in an anti-doping laboratory, where she helps determine the origin of steroids   whether endogenous or exogenous   in samples from athletes. 3 keys to a good education  Study what you love. If you love it, it s fun, not work. You won t spend all that energy motivating yourself to get to your readings.   Be curious! You don t always need a prof to read a book or to answer a question. Learning it for yourself is much more rewarding.  Don t sweat the small stuff. There are always bumps in the road, learn from them and stay confident in yourself.  2 lessons learned at Concordia  You don t have to wait until you re done with your studies to start living. You need your twenties to meet new people, try new things and just figure out who you are as an individual, not just as a professional.  No man (or woman) is an island. You don t need to figure everything out alone! If you re not the expert in something, find someone who is.  1 piece of advice for future grads People will always try to fit you into a labelled box. Surprise them. Well-rounded people don t fit in square boxes. You can be great at more than one thing.  Khoa Luu Valedictorian Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science Currently a research scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, Luu s PhD research at Concordia involved estimating peoples  ages based on digital imaging and extrapolating from existing images what they might look like as they grow older. Today, he leads biometric projects and collaborates with research scholars to build stand-alone biometric systems. Luu was a vice chair of the Montreal Chapter of  IEEE SMCS  (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; Systems, Man and Cybernetics) in Canada from September 2009 to March 2011. 3 keys to a good education   During your education, join strong teams with active advisors.   Cultivate your imagination to help solve problems and find creative solutions.   Work as hard as you can on each task. That s the key.  2 lessons learned at Concordia  Support! Always help your team members and other friends as much as you can.   Uphold a professional research environment.  1 piece of advice for future grads  Define your goals, make as many professional connections as possible and get ready for challenges.

For some young people, science can seem overwhelming. The stigma can start in school and continue into high school, depending on their teachers  enthusiasm and their access to resources. That s why Concordia is involved in several initiatives to dispel this myth by teaching and promoting science to youths through events like summer camps, fairs and tours of Concordia s labs. The goal is to create an interest in the field, not only for those on a scientific career path, but for any curious student. This fall, Concordia held two events committed to the interactive promotion of science: the Science Summit, held on October 24, and Exposcience, which occurred on November 1-2. Science Summit The Science Summit is a new initiative that brought CEGEP students and their teachers to Concordia, where they had the chance to discover what it s like to research in Concordia s science labs. They also had the opportunity to conduct guided experiments.  For the Science Summit, science should be read broadly, in that we re looking to provide opportunities in pure and applied, as well as social sciences and other disciplines,  says Bradley Tucker, vice-president of Registrarial Service. Due to growing interest from the CEGEP level, the Science Summit is now looking to expand into placements where college students from the Montreal area could gain experience in Concordia s labs.  The initiative aims to introduce college students to Concordia s state-of-the-art facilities. When it comes time for them to choose a university, they ll be aware of everything we have to offer,  says Tucker. Exposcience Celebrating its 31st anniversary in November of this year, Exposcience successfully brought together Concordia science students volunteers, young children and their parents. The exhibits and activities are designed to instil in the children an early interest in science and technology. Exposcience also gives Concordia students the chance to positively influence young people while showcasing what they re learning. Behind the event are Miriam Posner and Cameron Tilson, who have both been involved in Exposcience for more than 30 years. They share a passion for teaching kids about science and say the positive feedback they receive is highly rewarding.  It makes me proud to be a Concordian,  says Tilson, the assistant director for Institutional Planning.  And it takes me back to my own academic roots in the sciences as a Concordia graduate.  Tilson shared the story of a Concordia engineering graduate, now in a successful career in aerospace, who remembered coming to Exposcience in the early 1990s. He believes the event played a large part in both his choice of career and university. Posner added that Exposcience is family-oriented and that children and their parents engage in learning with Concordia s student volunteers.  One can t help but be energized by the enthusiasm of our students,  says Posner, the technical supervisor for the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry,  and by the expressions of fascination in the faces of children as they begin to take in and understand science and technology and see that it can be fun!

Arezou Azarani, BSc 92 | Photos courtesy of Azarani The topic is explored by Concordia alumna Arezou Azarani, BSc 92, and her husband Mehrdad Ayati, a medical doctor. Together, the duo wrote Paths to Healthy Aging (self-published, 2014). The book is a guide to quality of life for older adults.  We wanted to write something the general public could understand,  says Azarani. \"The majority of books on the subject are too technical.\" The San Francisco resident says the work took over a year to produce.    Our knowledge is quite complementary,  says Azarani on teaming up with her husband, who specializes in geriatrics. Azarani holds a PhD in physiology from McGill, completed a post-doctoral fellowship at Universit  de Montr al in 1997 and another at Stanford University in 1999. At Concordia, Azarani studied biochemistry and took advantage of the university s Institute for Co-operative Education.  It was wonderful. Concordia is my favourite university,  says Azarani. A new book co-authored by alumna Arezou Azarani and her husband Mehrad Ayati The Concordian offers four tips for healthy aging: 1. Be wary of marketing:  Vitamins and over-the-counter supplements have millions of dollars of advertising behind them. Data suggests most people get everything they need from a balanced diet.  Azarani notes the same can be said of exercise.  Fitness is highly commercialized. We re encouraged to join gyms, buy equipment and workout strenuously. Moderate exercise is usually enough.  2. Too much medication is a problem:  As we age, we deal with multiple chronic illnesses,  says Azarani.  As a result, lots of medications are prescribed.  Citing the U.S. as an example, nearly 40 per cent of seniors take over five medications. Drug interactions and side effects can be fatal, explains Azarani. 3. Think about nutrition:  With age, we lose our appetites and taste buds. The amount of muscle we have decreases,  says Azarani.  The best practice is to eat a range of foods that we enjoy and that are healthy.  The book itself emphasizes the importance of consuming fats, carbohydrates and protein   warning against diets that eliminate one of these groups. 4. Choose a physician wisely:  You should find someone you trust, who cares about your specific needs,  says Azarani. She notes that in the U.S. it can be difficult to find a primary care physician.

Concordia s Lanthanide Research Group works to better cancer therapy of the future Posted on February 18, 2015 | Source: Concordia University Magazine Diana Rodr guez Burbano holds a nanoparticle sample in a quartz tube in front of a 980-nanometre (nm) diode laser, and its contents begin to glow.  It s orangey-red,  says John Capobianco, professor in the Department of Chemistry and the Concordia University Senior Research Chair in Nanoscience. The glow, which emanates from nanoparticles doped with lanthanide ions, may one day light the way to more effective cancer diagnosis and therapy. Capobianco directs the Lanthanide Research Group, currently including post-doctoral fellow Nicoleta Bogdan, doctoral candidates Rodr guez Burbano, Paola Rojas Guti rrez and Ana Maria Ibarra Ruiz, master s student Qiang Ying Li, and undergraduate research student Rachel Hall. The lab is unusual for its high ratio of female researchers and while many male students have in the past worked under Capobianco, today s roster reflects the increase of women in the hard sciences. Team members of Concordia s Lanthanide Research Group include (from left) Ana Maria Ibarra Ruiz, Paola Rojas Guti rrez, Nicoleta Bogdan, Rachel Hall, and Diana Rodr guez Burbano. The team is also an international squad. Bogdan hails from Romania; she did her PhD research at Universit  du Qu bec   Montr al, with Capobianco as one of her co-supervisors, and joined the lab after completing her doctorate in 2009. Rodr guez Burbano, Rojas Guti rrez and Ibarra Ruiz come from Colombia; Li arrived at the lab from China.  Our focus is the detection, imaging and therapeutic treatment of disease,  says Capobianco. Together the group is helping to shape the cancer therapy of the future: a diagnosis, bio-imaging and drug delivery system that is non-invasive, non-toxic and highly efficient.  This vision is still a dream,  he stresses.  Lots of work needs to be done.  That work includes overcoming some formidable challenges, starting with building and adapting the lanthanide-doped nanoparticles to fit the job envisioned for them. The lab synthesizes most of its own nanoparticles   usually inorganic nanocrystals of sodium gadolinium fluoride or sodium yttrium fluoride   and  dopes  them with lanthanide ions, so one primary concern is understanding the structures and qualities of these nanoparticles, as well as identifying the processes that might subtly alter these qualities for particular purposes.  It s not so easy to synthesize these nanocrystals,  says Rojas Guti rrez, whose efforts focus on refining the nanocrystals for drug delivery.  It requires a lot of patience and perseverance.  Not-so hidden minerals Over the years Capobianco s graduate students have carried out research to understand the lanthanide dopants in the nanoparticles. Lanthanides, the 15 elements between atomic numbers 57 and 71 on the periodic table, are also known as the  rare earths,  as they were once (mistakenly) thought to be uncommon. Although the scientific community now frowns on the  rare earth  designation, even the formal Greek name lanthanein means  to lie hidden    likely because these elements are very difficult to separate from the minerals in which they are found. But under the right circumstances, lanthanides are anything but hidden   indeed, they shine out.  The lanthanides have very interesting properties, especially the fact that they can emit light in the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared region through a process called  upconversion,  Capobianco says. What this means is that irradiating the lanthanide ions with low-energy radiation from a simple and inexpensive 980-nm diode laser, thus  exciting  it, causes it to glow   just as with Rodr guez Burbano s nanoparticles sample.  Lanthanides can be excited at low energy and produce emissions at high energy, and they can do this because they have distinct and evenly spaced energy levels,  explains Capobianco.  Imagine the rungs on a ladder. When you excite at low energy, you take an electron from the lower level   the bottom rung   to a higher one and emit light of higher energy.  The upconversion phenomenon was first noted in the late 1960s, but upconverting lanthanide ions doped in nanoparticles emerged only in the late 1990s. Capobianco s lab was in the vanguard of that research   indeed, Capobianco has been working with lanthanides for over 30 years.  When we first started this nano-research in the 1990s, we did a lot of work to understand where the lanthanides are located in the nanoparticles, how they are spatially distributed and how long their excited state will last,  he says. The team used high-powered laser equipment to compile this basic knowledge. The Lanthanide Research Group, which is housed in the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex on the Loyola Campus, uses high-powered laser equipment for their scientific investigations. Capobianco then learned to synthesize lanthanide-doped nanoparticles and control their morphology, beginning a shift from fundamental to applied research   and then more narrowly to biomedical applications.  We incubated the nanoparticles into a cell culture in the lab to see if we could get an image by exciting the lanthanides with the laser,  he recounts.  We found that nanoparticles are taken up by the cells through endocytosis, a process in which the cell engulfs molecules sitting on its surface. And by using the infrared laser, we could get an image of the cell.  A major advantage of the low-energy infrared laser is that it can penetrate well below the body s surface, and then produce images with less scatter and a stronger focus than UV or visible light can provide. So the nanoparticles could be injected into cells and then the lanthanides could be excited, tracking the whereabouts of these particles. Of course, this is of little practical use if they travel aimlessly in cells; for diagnostic bio-imaging, the lanthanide-doped nanoparticles need to connect to the right cells.  That s a real challenge! Imagine the number of cells in the body   there are something like 1014 in someone weighing about 70 kilograms,  says Capobianco. Think of the nanoparticle as a vehicle   like a tiny ambulance   travelling through the human body: it needs something to tell it how to find the accident scene. While it isn t possible to develop a global positioning system for travelling within the body, or even within an in vitro cell culture, Capobianco s lab, collaborating with biomedical researchers, has identified a chemical beacon that will allow the nano-ambulances to home in on their destination. Certain cancer cells overexpress different molecules   that is, they send out specific chemicals that can be used as signals identifying the cells as malignant. So Bogdan, the team s resident targeting expert, is building on earlier research to outfit the nanoparticles with molecules that would be drawn to connect with the cancerous cells  over-expressed molecules   thus offering the possibility of a tool for early diagnosis. The team has shown that, at least in vitro   that is, in the lab   this compound will act as the driver guiding the nano-ambulances to the cancer. Cancer numbers in Canada Cancer Canada predicted that 97,700 men and 93,600 women would be diagnosed with cancer in 2014, and 40,000 men and 36,000 women would die from it. Indeed, according to the most recent statistics, cancer is the cause of death for almost 30 per cent of Canadians; 45 per cent of men and 41 per cent of women can expect to contract some form of cancer at some point in their lives. Nano-ambulance on the way If there is no cancer, the nanoparticles will have no beacon to guide them, and so will not conglomerate anywhere; if there is a cancer, they will be led to the chemical beacon and will cluster around the malignant cells. Once at the cancer zone, the lanthanide molecules start to earn their passage on the nanoambulance. Their first job is to set up the flares that say,  This is the danger area!    serving as both diagnosis and imaging. A low-energy infrared scan will cause the lanthanides to glow, marking the tumour and showing how large it is. This non-invasive imaging has the potential to offer quick and reliable diagnoses, but much work remains to be done   improving reliability and ensuring safety, for instance   before it can be tested in humans. Recently Rodr guez Burbano has been developing a new imaging approach that draws on nanophosphors doped with divalent and trivalent lanthanide ions to emit persistent luminescent light that requires charging outside the body. Once injected, the nanophosphors emit light under no excitation, which she hopes will maximize the reliability, brightness and lifespan of the emissions, making a more effective imaging tool. If the nano-ambulance can find the cancer cells, its logical next job is to kill them.  To do this we have to attach some kind of therapy cargo to the vehicle,  says Capobianco.  But that means we also have to figure out how it is going to act once it is at the cell.  Cancer therapies include photodynamic, chemical or thermal approaches to killing the cells, and the lab is exploring all of these. Photodynamic therapy, sometimes called photochemotherapy, involves using a photosensitive drug   that is, one activated by light   to produce a highly reactive form of oxygen called singlet oxygen, which then destroys cancer cells. Today, this is carried out by injecting the patient with the drug and then using visible light to scan the tumour site to release the drug; but the drug is not targeted so patients must stay out of the sunlight after receiving injections to avoid releasing the drug throughout the body, leading to the death of healthy cells as well. If a photosensitive drug can be delivered directly to the cancer cell by the nanoparticle and then activated by light at one of the wavelengths that can be produced by the excited lanthanides, the therapeutic process would be safer and more efficient. So Capobianco looked on the market for a drug that would absorb light at one of the lanthanides  wavelengths and thus produce singlet oxygen. Temoporfin, a drug approved in Europe, fit the bill. One of his previous graduate students, Jessica Yu, modified the drug, attached it to the nanoparticle, and irradiated it to produce singlet oxygen. The results: the drug killed 75 per cent of the cancer cells in in vitro experiments. Other applications The lab is also exploring chemotherapeutic applications. The lab attached doxorubicin, a chemotherapy drug, to the nanoparticle, and then used light from the upconverted lanthanides to prompt a photochemical reaction breaking the bond with the nanoparticle, releasing the drug into the cells and killing them. Currently, Rojas Guti rrez is exploring another way of delivering the drug using modified lipids with a photosensitive azobenzene molecule that built up liposome structures.  The drug is carried in these liposomes. In the moment we irradiate with 980-nm light, it causes a disruption in the structure and releases the drug,  she says. The lab s latest endeavour is the responsibility of its newest member, Ibarra Ruiz, who arrived in January 2014 and is building hybrid nanoparticles for bio-imaging.  I m trying to combine nanoparticles with quantum dots, which will have more desirable bio-imaging properties,  she explains.  Upconverted nanoparticles are not as bright as quantum dots, but quantum dots also are quite toxic. The hybrid is supposed to improve brightness and lower toxicity by confining the quantum dot in the core of the nanoparticle. This way we can avoid this toxicity while keeping the desirable property.  This innovative and challenging work offers the possibility of more effective imaging that could one day help turn the lab s vision into reality. Indeed, while using lanthanide-doped nanoparticles for bio-imaging and drug delivery shows promise in the lab, its use in humans remains far off in the future. But the proof of principle exists   Capobianco s lab has proved that these tiny nanoambulances can be used to detect, image and treat cancer cells. Capobianco is proud of his teams, present and past, and their research. Certainly his colleagues locally and abroad have taken note of the Lanthanide Research Group s endeavours: he can point to a huge number of awards, cover-story articles in leading journals, and international collaborations for both himself and his team members. And he is clear about where to place the credit.  I have always said my success   if one wants to call it that   has been from graduate students, because they re the ones in the lab doing the work,  he stresses.  I ve been very fortunate in my 30 years at Concordia. I have had excellent graduate students.

Though they studied in different fields   Ronald in science and Robert in history   they shared aspirations to make a difference. Their desire to better the world would take them both far in their respective journeys. After a distinguished career abroad with the World Bank, Robert Calderisi returned to Montreal, where he continues to write about aid to the developing world. Ronald Calderisi, BSc 68, completed a medical degree and went to work in northern Canada as a general practitioner on Baffin Island and in Inuvik. Robert Calderisi, BA 68, made history by becoming Loyola College s first Rhodes Scholar.  It was one of the two or three happiest moments of my life, not just because it opened the doors to that  wider world  but also because it honoured my professors and Loyola College,  says Robert. One of those professors was Geoffrey Adams, then chair of the Department of History.  He kindled in me a love of learning,  says Robert Calderisi. Another of his Loyola mentors was Donald Savage, one of the first professors in Canada to teach African history   an area of knowledge that would prove integral to Robert Calderisi s future career. After Oxford, Robert continued studies in economics and went on to a distinguished career with the World Bank. He was the bank s country division chief for Indonesia and the South Pacific from 1987 to 1989, head of the bank s Regional Mission in Western Africa in the Ivory Coast from 1991 to 1994, and its international spokesman on Africa from 1997 to 2000 and country director for Central Africa from 2000 to 2002. In 2002, Robert left the World Bank to pursue his passion for writing. His first book, The Trouble with Africa: Why Foreign Aid Isn t Working, published in 2006, brought fresh perspectives to the field of developmental aid and garnered wide appeal.  My main purpose is to encourage those who feel helpless about global poverty by showing them how far we have come, by shifting the discussion from the jargon of UN statements to the concrete achievements of individual people, communities and countries, and by replacing talk of constraints with inspiring examples of those who have overcome the odds,  he says. Ronald Calderisi, for his part, went on to become a skilled surgeon and practised in Vancouver for much of his career. He passed away in 2005. Soon after, Robert established the Dr. Ronald Calderisi Scholarship in Biochemistry at Concordia in memory of his brother. Donald Savage, Loyola College history professor, with Robert Calderisi during graduation ceremonies on the Loyola Campus in 1968.  He put his heart into his work. He ignored the traditional wisdom that doctors should not care deeply about their patients. He treated the whole person,  says Robert. In homage to his brother s lifelong attachment to Canada s northern communities, he requested the scholarship be prioritized to Concordia students of First Nations backgrounds. More recently, Robert made a planned gift to his alma mater by including Concordia in his will. Thanks to his initiative, the Dr. Ronald Calderisi Scholarship in Biochemistry will continue to assist students for generations to come.  When I first established the scholarship, I saw just how important my modest commitment was. After a few years, I decided to double the amount. Now, through planned giving, I m making an enduring contribution that will help students follow in my brother s path.

Marchessault, BSc 50, LLD 82, an accomplished scholar, chemist and athlete, died in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Que., on September 16, 2015, on his 87th birthday. Robert Marchessault The Montreal native was among the first graduates of the newly established chemistry program at Loyola College, one of Concordia s founding institutions. He continued his studies at McGill University, where he earned a PhD in chemistry in 1954. After postdoctoral studies at the University of Uppsala in Sweden, Marchessault became a research assistant at the American Viscose Corporation in Philadelphia. He then entered academia, joining the State University of New York (Syracuse) to teach polymer physical chemistry. In 1969, Marchessault returned to his hometown as a faculty member in Universit  de Montr al s Department of Chemistry. His tenure included a term as department chair. In 1978, he moved back to industry to become vice-president of the Xerox Research Centre of Canada in Mississauga, Ont. In 1987, he stepped back into the academic world   where he would remain for the rest of his career   as the Xerox-NSERC Industrial Research Chair in McGill s Department of Chemistry. Marchessault s McGill research focussed on developing biopolymer materials for imaging, drug delivery and environmental applications. He was appointed to the prestigious E.B. Eddy Chair of Industrial Chemistry in 1995. During his career, Marchessault published more than 300 scholarly papers and co-invented 20 patents. He was named professor emeritus of chemistry when he retired in 2005. Marchessault received many honours to recognize his influence in the advancement of scientific research. He won the Anselme Payen Award from the American Chemical Society in 1976 for outstanding teaching and research, and the Archambault Award (Pure and Applied Sciences) from l Association canadienne fran aise pour l avancement des sciences in 1981. The next year he was elected as a fellow to the Canadian Academy of Science and Concordia granted him an honorary doctorate. Marchessault was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2000 and received a Queen s Jubilee Medal in 2002. His scientific and academic achievements were only part of his legacy. Marchessault was an outstanding athlete. While at Loyola, he competed in football, track and field, boxing and hockey   he even played professional hockey for the Montreal Royals senior team. He was inducted into Concordia s Sports Hall of Fame in 1973. He also showed great interest in philosophy and theology. In the 1950s, Marchessault became one of the first participants in the Great Books discussion group in Montreal and later started a Great Books discussion group in Philadelphia. Throughout his life, Marchessault remained dedicated to his alma mater. He served as a member of Loyola s Board of Trustees from 1970 to 1973. Marchessault is survived by his wife of 63 years, Mary, as well as six children and 10 grandchildren. #CUalumni ","title":"Concordia mourns passing of Robert Marchessault"},{"url":"http://www.concordia.ca/artsci/chemistry/news/archive/cunews/main/stories/2015/10/22/marcus-lawrence-1956-2015-dynamic-charismatic-and-full-of-life.html","body":"Marcus Lawrence (1956   2015):  dynamic, charismatic and full of life  Concordia mourns a dedicated chemistry professor and researcher Posted on October 22, 2015 | Source: University Communications Services  His enthusiasm for education was obvious and his teaching through real-life examples made even difficult subjects accessible,  says Christine DeWolf, a colleague of Marcus Lawrence of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. | Concordia University archives Members of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry were saddened to learn of the sudden death of their colleague, Marcus Lawrence , last week.  Dynamic, charismatic and full of life, professor Lawrence will be missed by all,  says interim department chair Christine DeWolf .  He will be remembered as a professor always popular with his students and as a valued colleague.  Lawrence joined the department in 1986 and went on to become a full professor. Among his numerous contributions to Concordia during his career, Lawrence served twice as academic director of Chemistry and Biochemistry for the Institute for Co-operative Education and two terms as department chair, from 2000 to 2006. As chair, he helped oversee the creation of the department s space in the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex, and the subsequent move from the Sir George Williams Campus to Loyola.  A physical and analytical chemist, Professor Lawrence was a dedicated teacher who will be fondly remembered by his students for his engaging style, personal connection with his students and good sense of humour,  says DeWolf.  His enthusiasm for education was obvious and his teaching through real-life examples made even difficult subjects accessible.  Lawrence s specialty in teaching and research was electrochemistry and electronic materials. His research was highly applied, attracting funding from non-traditional sources including NanoQu bec . Over his career, Lawrence authored more than 50 publications in his field and directed 16 MSc and PhD students. In the latter years, he focused on the development of flexible, low-cost, impedance-based biosensors.   A funeral will be held on Friday, October 23, 2015 at the La Maison Fun raire Desnoyers (1981 Boulevard de P rigny, Chambly). The family will greet people from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Eulogies will be delivered at 1 p.m., followed by a light lunch.

Or remove the BRCA breast cancer mutation from a child s genetic code? Both those things, and many more, are moving closer to the realm of possibility with the relatively recent discovery of a gene-editing tool called CRISPR , or \"Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.\" It can alter the DNA of every organism on the planet, including humans, with precision and ease.  The CRISPR quandary The implications are staggering   for both medical breakthroughs and unforeseen negative outcomes. That s why this week,  international experts are meeting in Washington, D.C. , to grapple with the scientific, ethical and regulatory issues associated with CRISPR at the first  International Summit on Human Gene Editing . We asked Christopher J. Wilds , an associate professor in Concordia s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , to talk with us about what The New York Times Magazine dubbed \"The Crispr Quandary\". Christopher Wilds:  We need to decide how far we can go  What was your reaction when you heard about CRISPR? Christopher Wilds: Well, I was quite interested. I first fell in love with nucleic acid while doing my undergraduate degree at Concordia, and then my PhD project at McGill was dealing with chemically modified DNA for therapeutic application. I ve always been interested at the nucleic acid level. So, yeah, I thought,  Wow! What a great new technique!  There have been other, previous nucleic acid-based therapeutic strategies, but one of the things about CRISPR is that the modifications are permanent, whereas some of these other nucleic acid therapeutic interventions are an ongoing-type process.  What s the quandary surrounding CRISPR? CW: The quandary is about the moral and ethical questions that come into play. This discovery could go in so many directions. For example, we could edit out a defective gene, or maybe there s an industrial application that would benefit society. But there s always the worry that it could damage things like ecosystems. Then there s the Dr. Frankenstein situation, where we re making designer babies and playing God. That s when, as a society, we need to decide how far we can go with gene editing. That will be complicated and hard to enforce  CW: Yes. Many sectors of society need to be involved with making regulatory and ethical decisions   not just scientists, but industry, politicians and community leaders. We ve all got to come together on ethics boards, commissions and governmental regulatory bodies. But it ll be hard to strike the right balance. While CRISPR needs ethical boundaries, you don t want research limitations that are too draconian because that s where interesting discoveries come from. Sometimes, it isn t so straightforward where a project is going to lead. If we put too many rules on ourselves, it limits discovery. At the same time, we have to be responsible. The Summit is the first step in creating some kind of moral compass. Find out more about Concordia s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry .

There has been tremendous effort devoted to developing what are now commonly referred to as nanocarriers that can help us overcome physicochemical obstacles in their delivery. Lessons learnt from these studies have necessitated a shift in paradigm to combine multiple functions into a single scaffold of a nanostructure. An important parameter for constructing multi-tasking scaffolds is to develop tools, which can be utilized to assemble multivalent structures with desired spatial distribution of therapeutic, stealth, imaging and targeting capabilities. The synthetic methodologies need to be simple and highly versatile, and applicable to a variety of nanoarchitectures. We shall elaborate on the evolution of macromolecule based nanotechnology, demonstrate how one can easily construct multivalent nanoconjugates of desired structural complexity that can perform multiple tasks and help visualize drug delivery, and discuss their potential in smart and efficient therapeutic interventions.

On Monday, November 30, the first-ever Dean s Reception to Honour Excellence was held at the Loyola Jesuit Hall and Conference Centre. The celebration grew out of the annual Dean s Awards ceremony, which celebrated the achievements of staff and faculty.  This year, we wanted to expand the evening to include our new Concordia University Research Chairs, Canada Research Chairs and other research chairs, whose incredible work highlights the strengths of our faculty every day,  said Andr  Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science. Jason Camlot , associate dean of Faculty Affairs, oversaw the selection committee for the awards. He noted the overwhelming number of recommendations the three winners received. Winning staff members received a $500 gift certificate, and faculty members received $500 in research funding.   Staff and faculty award winners Gilles Pelsherbe , a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , won for Distinguished Scholarship in the Senior Scholar Category.  He is an extremely productive researcher,  said Camlot. Viviane Namaste , a professor in the Simone de Beauvoir Institute , won for Teaching Excellence. Camlot praised her for her extensive mentorship over the years.  Her students have been transformed by her personal interventions, and by her example,  he said. But perhaps the most memorable of the three winners was Ron Rehel , who recently retired from the Department of Exercise Science as a technical supervisor, following a 36-year career. Rehel received a standing ovation from the crowd when he accepted his award for Exceptional Service to the Faculty.  I always held the Concordia family in high esteem,  said Rehel.  It was a pleasure to work with these folks. In so many ways they are the reason I ended up receiving my award. I love my Concordia life!    Chair winners Next, the faculty s new research chairs were honoured.  They are chosen because of the vision for research in the faculty that they articulated in their applications for chair, and the leadership that they are expected to provide by holding the chair,  said Kim Sawchuk, the faculty s associate dean, Research and Graduate Studies. When he presented the chairs with their certificates and prizes, Roy put the academics on the spot. He asked them to sum up their field of research in one sentence. Thanh Dang-Vu , assistant professor and a Concordia Research Chair joked,  I put people to sleep.  He s a leader in the field of sleep study. Following the ceremony, guests had the chance to mix and mingle with honourees, department chairs, colleagues, friends and family.  We hold many events throughout the year to honour our students, but none of our students  success would be possible without the exceptional staff and faculty we have here,  said Roy.  Tonight is to honour them. I am pleased to congratulate each of tonight s honourees, and salute their success in the company of their colleagues.

This month, an official-looking envelope arrived from the  Royal Society of Chemistry  in London, England. Inside was a letter and certificate that welcomed him as a fellow into the society.  I m honoured, of course, and humbled knowing that the international community recognizes the work I ve done over the past 30 years,  says Capobianco, who is also the Concordia University Research Chair in nanoscience. Royal Society of Chemistry With more than 51,000 members, the society is the UK s professional body for chemical scientists. Founded in 1841, the not-for-profit organization invests in educating future generations of scientists, maintains standards, advises government policy and partners with industry and academia, promoting collaboration and innovation. Each year, the names of new fellows are published in The Times of London. John Capobianco:  I m honoured and humbled that the international community recognizes the work I ve done over the past 30 years.  Fellows are elected for having made a substantial contribution to the improvement of natural knowledge, including mathematics, engineering science and medical science. Concordia s Lanthanide Research Group Capobianco s work at his  Lanthanide Research Group  involves optical spectroscopy, synthesis, and uses lanthanide-doped nanoparticles for potential applications in cell targeting, including bioimaging, diagnostic medicine, photodynamic therapy and drug delivery through photo-switching to target disease.  The idea is to improve drug delivery,  says Capobianco.  For example, with cancer and chemotherapy, the drugs end up throughout your body. We want to be able to deliver the drugs directly to the site of the tumour. That s the long-term outlook.  To get there, the research group is experimenting using lanthanides doped nanoparticles.  We re using light to do all this,  explains Capobianco, who got his PhD at the University of Geneva, and founded the research group at Concordia in 1986.  That s our main focus. We use light to do the imaging, light to do the diagnostic, light to do the photodynamic therapy.  Praise for his students When Capobianco speaks about his work at the lab, he uses the royal  we  and insists on spreading the credit for the Lanthanide Research Group among his past and present students.  Over the past 30 years, I ve had really excellent students and that has been the key to the success the research group has had,  he says.  I cannot give them enough praise   for the undergrad students in the summers, to master s students, to PhDs and post-docs. We re in a very competitive field today and there s a lot of work being done all over the world. However, we re one of the main players. My students have so much drive and passion for the work that we do.

If you think this will be a collection of erupting baking soda volcanos then prepare to be surprised   and very impressed. Over 200 Montreal area high school and CEGEP students will be pitching research projects in areas ranging from engineering, to health and wellness, to computer software.  The curiosity and imagination of these young people is astounding,  says Graham Carr , vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.  They are already tackling some of society s greatest challenges. I highly encourage all of our community to meet these talented innovators and discover their great work.  Here is a sample of some of the amazing projects that were on display last year.  Fighting cancer cells   organically Two students form Westmount s The Study want to help develop organic cancer fighting drugs that are safer for the body than pharmaceuticals currently found on the market. Tiffany Mach and Catherine Boisvert based their project on research they undertook at the Lady Davis Institute of the Jewish General Hospital, where they tested the effects of natural compounds found in fruit, nuts and leaves on killing cancerous cells.  We injected cancerous cells with compounds from Indian gooseberries as well as extracts of this fruit. These results were then compared to cells injected with a newly developed pharmaceutical called BKM120,  explains Mach.  We then measured the density of the cancerous cells, in order to analyze the effectiveness of these compounds.  Results demonstrated that the pharmaceutical killed the most cancer cells of all the compounds tested. However, it also killed normal cells. Interestingly, what Boisvert and Mach found was that the Indian gooseberry compound was the second most effective at killing cancer cells and was a lot less harmful for normal cells. Helping the blind navigate with wearable technology Laurier Senior High School student Wilfred Mason is a programmer who s passionate about assisting the visually impaired better navigate public spaces. Using his basement as his laboratory, he has developed prototypes of several pieces of wearable technology that allow the blind to identify obstacles using vibratory-tactile feedback. One of the devices is a headband that conveys electro-impulses to the brain, which create vibrations that intensify as a person approaches an object.  I m also developing a way in which these vibrations can be traced into basic shapes in the brain so that the person wearing the headband can get a sense of an object ahead of them,  he says.  The whole point is to be able to comfortably avoid obstacles.  Mason has also developed a wristband application that can detect objects from up to three meters away, as well as a vibrating insole that provides the user with an awareness of objects located below the knee. Attacking cancer at its roots Under the mentorship of doctors Nahum Sonenberg and Soroush Tahmasebi of the McGill University Health Centre , Jeremy Lebvett of Herzliah High School has been working with a team of scientists trying to determine the potential role of certain proteins in embryonic stem cells.  We determined that the proteins we investigated allow stem cells to be pluripotent,  says Levett.  This means that these proteins allow stem cells to have the ability to become any other type of cells.  Such a discovery could have a huge impact on stamping out cancer at its root.  The major problem with chemotherapy is that it can only kill cancer cells and not cancer stem cells,  explains Levett.  Seeing the close relationship between stem cells and cancer stem cells, by knowing the main proteins involved in the pluripotency of cancer stem cells, we can inhibit the formation of these proteins and put an end to the growth of cancer.  The Hydro-Qu bec Montreal Regional Science and Technology Fair displays will be set up on the ground floor atrium of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (1515 St. Catherine W.) on the Sir George William Campus.

Heme is synthesized in an eight-step process that finalizes with the insertion of ferrous ion (Fe2+) into the porphyrin. This reaction is catalyzed by ferrochelatase (FECH), but no heme acceptor that interacts directly or indirectly with FECH has yet been described. Interestingly, cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1) is a heme protein that is synthesized in fermenting yeast before heme accumulation. Thus, apoCcp1 may be a heme acceptor of FECH, but these proteins appear to be localized on different sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Pet9, a highly abundant ATP/ADP transporter in the inner membrane has additionally been characterized as a heme transporter and was found to be both a Ccp1 and FECH interactor in pulldown studies. My aim is to characterize in detail the interaction between Ccp1, Pet9 and FECH and, as a starting point, I optimized expression of GST-apoCcp1 and of the GST control in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. I added purified recombinant GST-apoCcp1 as bait or GST as a control to lysates of the mitochondrial-enriched (P10) fraction from 1-day BY4741 yeast cells. To solubilize the inner membrane, 20 mM N-octylglucoside was also added to the P10 lysates. Pet9 and mitochondrial matrix proteins such as aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase were detected in the GST-apoCcp1 pulldowns, which confirms successful solubilization of the membrane. Nevertheless, extensive cleavage of GST-apoCcp1 in the P10 lysates was detected by SDS-PAGE with silver staining. Fresh PMSF, a serine protease inhibitor, was added to P10 fractions to prevent cleavage of GST-apoCcp1, which reduces the sensitivity of pulldown assays. This and other strategies to optimize pulldown assays will be discussed. *Rahman, M. S. (1) (1) Concordia University The enzyme tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (tRNA-NT) is involved in adding cytosine-cytosine-adenine (CCA) to the 3  end of eukaryotic tRNAs during their maturation, which is required for aminoacylation and protein synthesis. In yeast, this enzyme is defined as a Class II tRNA-NT due to the presence of multiple conserved N-terminal Motifs. Based on available crystal structures of related tRNA-NTs, specific functions have been defined to these motifs. One goal of this project is to better understand the role of Motif C, the least well characterized motif, in enzyme structure and function. Studying tRNA-NT variants containing amino acid substitutions at E189 and D190 in Motif C, shows reduced enzyme activity. Another goal is to understand how an alteration in Motif A (at R64) restores enzyme activity in those low-activity variants of Motif C. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopic analyses suggest no major changes in structure in the variants suggesting that changes caused by the substitutions act locally. Thermal stability is affected in some variants. Kinetic analyses showed no alterations in substrate binding (Km) for ATP, CTP or tRNA, but a reduction in turnover number (kcat) for the 189 and 190 variants, and an increase in kcat in the position 64 double variants. These data suggest that Motif C may play a role in accommodating and orienting the substrates to promote catalysis. Proteolysis experiments using chymotrypsin suggest a reorientation of residues in the R64W variants hinting that this variant causes a change in organization at Motif A that in turn increases catalytic efficiency. *Sakeer, K. (1); Ispas-Szabo, P. (1); Mateescu, M. A. (1) (1) Universit  du Qu bec   Montr al (UQAM) The novel Ampholytic CarboxyMethyl-AminoEthyl-starch (CM-AE-St) polymer was synthesized first by starch treatment with sodium monochloroacetate to obtain CM-St and then by treatment with 2-chloroethylamine hydrochloride in order to introduce AminoEthyl (AE) groups. The CM-AE-St was characterized by physical methods, FT-IR, 1H NMR, SEM, TG, X-ray diffraction and by in vitro drug dissolution. Higher DS for both CM- and AE- groups favor the ability of ampholytic CM-AE-St to control the drugs release of high soluble drugs such as Metformin followed in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). For instance, monolithic tablets with CM-AE-St (DS 0.06 for CM and 0.059 for AE groups) and with metformin loading 50% similar shape and weight to the commercial Glumetza , were able to prolong liberation of active drugs up to 10h, exhibiting a similar dissolution profile to that of commercial product. The presence of both (cationic and anionic) functional groups generates a self-stabilized polymer with improved ability to control the drug delivery. The release profiles show a good fit to Higuchi s model (r2 > 0.99). The release pattern obtained with the ampholytic starch excipient seems to be in good agreement with the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) requirements for metformin controlled release tablets. *Tchoumi Ner e, A.

In Canada, up to 15% of the population suffer from IBD. The therapies available are mostly based on corticosteroids and on non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) know to present various undesirable side effects. Diamine oxidase (DAO) is a protein extracted from lentil seedlings. It oxidizes primary biogenic amines (i.e. putrescine and histamine) producing the corresponding aldehydes, NH4+ and H2O2. Histamine is a mediator of anaphylactic reactions and a proinflammatory factors. The disequilibrium between the accumulated histamine and the capacity for DAO to generate allergic phenomena and a harmful effect on subjects suffering of IBD. The aim of this project is to characterize the diamine oxydase (DAO) formulated with gastro-resistant excipients for an oral administration to reinforce the endogenous intestinal DAO. A special attention was to characterize the biological impact of the biliary acids on DAO activity. The spectrophotometry, fluorimetry and circular dichro sme analysis revealed that the cholic acid or deoxycholic acid protect enzyme and prevent the loss of its activity in presence of 0.1M of NaHCO3 or NaOH. This study shows that cholic and deoxycholic acid may play an important function in maintain DAO activity. *Yasmina, N.

(1) (1) Concordia University Bacterial secondary metabolites represent an important source of antimicrobial agents that could greatly help in human s battle against pathogens. For example, previous studies indicate that gram-negative bacteria Photorhabdus luminescens produce a number of antibiotics. However, secondary metabolites are highly regulated in bacteria, which leads to difficulties in extraction and isolation. A plausible approach to overcome tight regulation could be to introduce of additional copies of transcription initiation factors or/and enhancer binding proteins. This could potentially upregulate DNA transcription of secondary metabolite gene cluster. Hence, s-54 transcription initiation factor and a constitutively active form of enhancer binding protein DctD were independently used to transform P. luminescens via plasmids. Firstly, P. luminescens transformed with s-54 gene, rpoN, showed no phenotypic difference to wild type. On the other hand, DctD transformation displayed a new product with blue glow under long wave UV light. Further on, LC/MS and tandem MS studies of DctD-positive cell extract show the formation of new compounds and a reduction in the production of others. HPLC-UV-Vis provided UV data corresponding to MS peaks of interest. Future work will be to grow large quantities of DctD-positive P. luminescens, test for antimicrobial activity, and obtain structures via 2D-NMR and/or crystallography. *Allaire, A. (1); Boivin, G.

(1); Bloudoff, K. (1); Schmeing, M. (1) (1) McGill University Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are large multimodular mega-enzymes that catalyze peptide bonds resulting in the formation of biologically interesting compounds such as bleomycin (anti-tumor). Each module contains three integral domains including the adenylation domain (A) which transports the substrate to the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) arm. The PCP domain of the current module and the PCP arm of the previous module will transport their covalently bound substrates to the condensation (C) domain where the peptide bond is catalyzed. The growing peptide chain will eventually be transported to the C domain of the next module where elongation continues. The C domain is sometimes replaced with a cyclization (Cy) domain in non-canonical NRPSs. They are responsible for two reactions. The first involves the formation of a peptide bond. The latter involves forming 5-membered heterocyclic rings with cysteine, threonine and serine side chains resulting in oxazole and thiazole ring formation found in anti-tumor compounds such as epothilone. The function of the Cy domain has not been fully elucidated. However, NRPSs are great in that rearranging different modules can produce novel therapeutic products. Insufficient knowledge of the C and the Cy domain has lead to efforts that result in low product yields. The hope is to do structural and biochemical experiments with the Cy domain to better understand its function. *Ghilarducci, K. (1); Djerir, B. (1); Desroches, C. (1); Arteau,, J. (1); Bourgault; S.

Semana, P. - A novel gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase from Aspergillus niger: functional characterization and identification of residues critical for activity *Semana, P. (1); Powlowski, J. (1,2) (1) Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Concordia University, Montreal, QC (2) Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics, Concordia University, Montreal, QC Ring-cleavage dioxygenases catalyze the critical oxygen-dependent ring-opening reaction in the metabolism of aromatic compounds by bacteria and fungi. While ring-cleavage dioxygenases of bacterial origin have been relatively well-studied, fungal enzymes from this group of enzymes are poorly characterized. Here, we report the functional characterization and identification of residues critical for activity of a novel gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (GDO) from Aspergillus niger. Using a structural superposition of a homology-based model for the fungal enzyme, and the bacterial GDO template structures, we identified residues potentially involved in catalysis and/or substrate binding based on their positions relative to the bound substrate. We then generated and purified C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged variant proteins of A. niger-GDO, with residues Gln-92, His-150 and Asp-162 substituted by alanine, and residue Leu-166 by Ile. We found that, while single substitution variants H150A and D162A are not catalytically active, they are still able to bind gentisate as shown by a fluorescence-based ligand-binding assay. This loss of catalytic activity is not due to altered structural integrity of the variant proteins, as shown by circular dichroism and fluorescence emission spectra similar to the wild type. Furthermore, based on the observed kinetic parameters, we propose that residue Gln-92 is involved in catalysis but probably not in the initial binding of the substrate since its kcat value is 30-fold lower that of the wild type, with a Km for gentisate not significantly changed. Moreover, L166I had kinetic properties similar to the wild type enzyme indicating that the side chain of isoleucine can function equally well for that of leucine s in substrate binding and catalysis. This work will serve as basis for further understanding the structure and activity relationships in gentisate 1,2-dioxygenases.

Brion spent time on the Canadian Coast Guard ship Amundsen, while researching organisms living in sub-zero arctic waters  I was there during the  black period  of the year, as they call winter up there,  says Brion, who ventured to the area north of Inuvik, N.W.T., in 2003.  There s about three hours of daylight. Even then you don t see the sun   it just looks like sunset.  Along with 20 other researchers stationed upon the over 5,000 ton icebreaker, Brion was studying living organisms contained in the water s free-floating sediments and sealed within its frozen counterpart. That artic fieldwork informed Brion s PhD dissertation, Organic matter in preservation in marine sediments, and his post-Concordia entrepreneurial endeavours. In 2013, Brion founded and is vice-president of Biomolecules for Life Incorporated, based in Moncton, N.B.  My company harvests active ingredients from organisms in the water   mainly algae,  says Brion, referring to the ubiquitous oceanic plant-like group.  We then use those molecular bits to manufacture health products.  The first ware Brion and his company have brought to market is called  OceanSlim.  Coming as a soft-gel capsule, Brion says his merchandise promotes natural weight loss. The Health Canada-approved OceanSlim works on three levels, according to Brion: it inhibits fat formation, boosts the baseline number of calories the body requires, even while inactive, and it curbs appetite.  Brion spent time on the Canadian Coast Guard ship Amundsen, while researching organisms living in sub-zero arctic waters.  Most people lose almost half a kilogram per week,  says Brion of the product that sells exclusively online.  It s not healthy to lose weight at a faster rate than that.  One of the more challenging parts of his work, says Brion, are the production hurdles that include filing for patents in Canada and the United States, as well as submitting clinical test results to federal food and health regulatory bodies in both countries.  It took three years to develop OceanSlim,  says Brion, who is going through the process again with two more products he hopes to retail by 2017.

If you ve ever wanted to learn how to fix a typo, add a citation or create a whole new article on the world s most popular online encyclopedia , now s your chance. In celebration of Science Literacy Week, Concordia University Library is partnering with McGill Library to host a  Women in Science Wikipedia edit-a-thon this Wednesday, September 21. The event will focus on editing, improving and writing Wikipedia content about women who contributed to the sciences.  Editing scientist entries in Wikipedia is a great way to meld science with information literacy skills,  says Krista Alexander , chemistry, biochemistry and physics subject librarian and co-organizer of the event.  It showcases the importance of thinking critically about the information sources students are using and citing those sources properly.  While the event is focused on women in science, all are welcome to participate and no Wikipedia editing experience is necessary. The Concordia University Library views the event as an inclusive opportunity to learn.  Wikipedia is the most comprehensive encyclopedia we currently have, but it s a work in progress,  explains Pamela Carson , web wervices librarian.  It s a crowd-sourced project and each of us has the ability to make it a little more comprehensive, complete and correct. I d like students to understand how information gets on Wikipedia, and learning how to edit Wikipedia reveals this process.  The edit-a-thon will start at 2 p.m. with a brief tutorial on how to edit Wikipedia. This will be followed by a group editing session, where experienced Wikipedia editors and librarians will help participants one-on-one and answer questions. Assistance will be provided for Wikipedia newcomers as needed throughout the event and drop-in participation is welcome. Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops if they have them, but laptops can also be borrowed from the Circulation Desk on LB-2. Carson says an academic library is the perfect setting for a Wikipedia edit-a-thon, mainly because it s a great place to do research.  We have access to millions of scholarly articles and books which can be used as high-quality sources to support assertions made in Wikipedia.  Concordia's Women in Science Wikipedia edit-a-thon takes place this Wednesday, September 21, between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. in Room LB-322 of the Webster Library, located in the  J.W.

It is a genetic epidemiological infrastructure consisting of a large databank and biobank, with regulatory oversight and governance. We have recruited 42,000 individuals, aged 40 to 69 years, representing 6 metropolitan regions of the province and collected detailed lifestyle, health and medical data on these individuals, and detailed physical measurements, clinical and biochemical measures at baseline. We have also collected whole blood, urine and have DNA and RNA available for the participants. The cohort is not disease-specific and captures a representative cross-section of the diseases in the population. We have conducted detailed nutrition surveys on a subset of the participants and an environmental survey, which includes full residential information and 6-digit postal code resolution allowing for exposure assessments when linked to governmental databases for exposure. Exploiting this data will enable the integration of gene by environment interactions to explain the etiology of chronic diseases. The sociodemographic characteristics of the cohort are similar to those reported in the Census, with a slight skewing towards more educated participants. In addition, the prevalence of chronic, common diseases is comparable to that reported by Stats Can. CARTaGENE is the Quebec representative of nation-wide cohort, the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Cohort (CPTP), which includes 5 regional cohorts (BC, Alberta, Ontario and the Atlantic provinces), with the aim of collecting 300,000 samples from the population. CARTaGENE has been offering access to the data and biosamples since 2010 and offers open access, therefore no collaborations are needed. More than 25 projects have been granted access in the last 5 years and some will be highlighted. About the speaker Suzana obtained her PhD from McGill University in Human Genetics with a focus on the Genetics of Type 1 Diabetes. She moved on to more translational research in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) as part of her postdoctoral training.

From astronomy to culinary chemistry, these educational offerings will whet your appetite Posted on September 20, 2016 | By: Meagan Boisse  Did you enjoy The Martian? If so, we may have a course for you.  | Image: Twentieth Century Fox In celebration of Science Literacy Week (Sept. 19-25), the Concordia news desk is highlighting a related activity every day. See Monday's Wiki for women in STEM!  and Wednesday's  Rocketry and robotics at Space Concordia . So you re not a scientist. But like anyone with an inquisitive mind, you still grapple with life s existential questions: Who are you? What are you? Where did you come from? How close to reality is Jurassic Park? Good news! You don t need be an expert to explore the realms of science and space. Concordia offers a myriad of courses that address some of these fundamental queries while exploring a range of subjects, from the vast expanses of the universe to the tiniest life-giving particles.   General Biology  Do you want to know why you need to eat food and breathe oxygen? The difference between science and pseudoscience? Or what your ancient ancestors looked like? Then General Biology is for you,  says Madoka Gray-Mitsumune , who teaches BIOL 202: General Biology. The course covers the fundamentals of biology and the chemistry of life. Learn about the structure and functions of cells and tissues, as well as aspects of anatomy, physiology, taxonomy, heredity and evolution.  It s designed for non-scientists who are still curious about life. Through it you will learn the makings of life using everyday examples,  says Gray-Mitsumune.   Fundamental Nutrition Where does cooking and science collide? In BIOL 203: Fundamental Nutrition, of course, where you ll take a hands-on approach to food composition.  Cooking teaches us food chemistry. Thankfully, every home still comes equipped with a kitchen,  says instructor Catherine Calogeropoulos , who teaches her students the science of nutrition through an array of culinary experiments. Can you use milk in a sauce recipe that calls for cream? Probably not, says Calogeropoulos. Relative to milk, cream contains a lot less protein. Under high heat, milk can cause the sauce to curdle   and make you look like a foolish foodie.  Science reveals itself magically before our eyes in the kitchen. By perusing the molecular gastronomy literature I ve found perfect cooking examples to anchor nearly all the scientific concepts that might elude my students and senior auditors,  she says.   Fundamentals of Health and Physical Activity This course touches upon a range of topics: cardiovascular and muscular fitness, flexibility, weight management, nutrition, disease prevention and even stress management.  Students will gain both knowledge and tools to maximize their health and energy, immediately and in the long term,  says instructor Leslie Barker, who teaches EXCI 251: Fundamentals of Health and Physical Activity.  Many students comment that EXCI 251 helped them improve their own negative eating, smoking, stress and inactivity habits, while they also learned to differentiate between scientific facts and marketing hype,  adds Barker.   Forensic Analysis Everyone knows that DNA analysis revolutionized forensics, but how? If you want to find out,  Cameron Skinner , associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, suggests you take CHEM 298 AA.  Our approach is to first learn the underlying principles by starting with the basics such as molecules, chemical reactions and so on, before working our way towards the sophisticated tools used in a modern forensics lab,  says Skinner.  You will finish the course with a more realistic understanding of the field of forensics. You'll also understand the capacities and limitations of modern analysis. Some of the lessons will be case studies, some will be drawn from the textbook ... and there will be an occasional poisoning and/or murder.  Please note: Skinner says he will not take responsibility for any damages or strife caused when you begin yelling at your TV during crime shows such as CSI.   Discovering Biotechnology  Did you enjoy The Martian?  Were you thrilled by Jurassic Park?  Did Gattaca give you pause for thought? If so, we may have a course for you,  says Paul Joyce , a professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Concordia. CHEM 209: Discovering Biotechnology begins with an exploration of the roles that genes and proteins play in life processes. It then examines the basic principles behind the manipulation of biological molecules to produce desired changes. The course also explores the ethical ramifications of such actions.  Would you like to know how close we are to establishing a base on Mars? Or if we can really clone dinosaurs (or people, for that matter)? Or how close we are to the spectre of genetic discrimination?  asks Joyce.  Then register for this course.    Introduction to Astronomy Black holes, constellations, the Milky Way galaxy and beyond   PHYS 284: Introduction to Astronomy is the course for anyone interested in space.  Students will be introduced to advanced topics from cosmology, including the Big Bang theory, as well as the study of extra-solar planets and the search for extraterrestrial life,  says Mario D Amico from Concordia s Department of Physics. PHYS 284 will be offered as an online course this winter session. Browse through multimedia components and narrated lectures on major topics in astronomy, from the comfort of your own couch.  Students will have the flexibility of taking the course using their computers. They will therefore not be required to travel, or even be located in Montreal,  adds D'Amico.

Which is where these two Concordia graduate students come in... Maniya Aghasibeig is a PhD candidate with the Electro-Catalytic Green Engineering Group  and the  Thermal Spray Laboratory in the  Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering . Cindy Buonomano is a PhD student in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry  and president of the Chemistry and Biochemistry Graduate Student Association.   Why did you become a scientist or an engineer? Cindy Buonomano:  Ever since I was a little girl, I've known I wanted to be a scientist. I read scientific magazines, watched scientific TV shows and made my own observations from scientific experiments. Cindy Buonomano Naturally, in school, I oriented my education towards science and, more specifically, chemistry. I was interested in finding out how everything works on a molecular level. Chemistry has brought many great moments of joy to my life. In high school, I was able to travel to Paris for a contest when I was only 17 years old. And now, here I am in Quebec to realize my dreams and maybe become a professor who can inspire other young scientists. Maniya Aghasibeig: I became fascinated with materials science after I took a high school course on the subject, and got familiar with various types of materials (metals, ceramics, polymers etc.) with different structures and properties. A year later, just prior to choosing an undergraduate major, I met someone who studied in the field, and he explained to me about its diversity and its flexibility: it can be used in many different technologies, from aerospace to health care. That was when I knew that I wanted to study in this field. Usually when I first contact people by email and introduce myself as a PhD candidate who studies mechanical engineering, they assume that I am a guy. Later, when we meet in person or speak on the phone, they are very surprised to see/hear a girl! Tell us about what you're researching now, and why. CB: I am currently a PhD student in organic chemistry. I decided to take the PhD path because I want to be a professor. In the last few years, while supervising undergraduate students, I discovered a true passion for teaching. In organic chemistry, our goal is to build drugs or molecules with a potential material application. To do it, we have to develop new methods to synthesize these interesting molecules. My research project is \"Synthesis of Heteroaromatic Compounds via Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling and Directed Ortho-Metalation Reactions.\" Maniya Aghasibeig MA: I work on manufacturing nickel electrodes using different thermal spraying techniques for hydrogen production by water electrolysis. This hydrogen can be stored, converted and used later   for instance, for electricity production with no emissions other than water vapour. The need for green and renewable energy resources arises from increasing concerns about the depletion of fossil fuels, in addition to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming that occur alongside the fast development of modern industries. These manufactured electrodes are expected to increase the efficiency of the water electrolysis process by increasing the rate of hydrogen production and lowering the process costs.  Were you inspired by other women in your field? MA: My mentor was my boss from my last industrial job: Barbara Maroli at H gan s AB in Sweden. She was extremely knowledgeable, determined and successful in her career. She became my role model the first day I met her. When I told her that I wanted to study for a PhD she was truly encouraging and supportive. She helped me to explore my options and make a decision with confidence. CB: Many women inspired me, like  Marie Curie , who got the Nobel Prize in chemistry and in physics, and  Valentina Tereshkova , the first woman to go to space. I told my little self that if these women were able to go that far, why can't I? I've had so many people in my life tell me that I would not succeed in my studies and I should stop. I am glad I never listened to them! It is hard to be a woman in a world dominated by male scientists, but trust me: you are as good as them. So be strong, and inspire other little girls to do the same. Find out how to study  mechanical and industrial engineering  or  chemistry and biochemistry  at Concordia.

With governments like Quebec s looking to  ban organic waste  from landfills by 2020, we need to act fast to reduce the amount of food scraps we re throwing out.  A study recently published in  Waste Management  by researchers from Concordia s Faculty of Arts and Science  shows that one method of composting could yield high quality compost and high value by-products. The catch? There are worms involved.  The study s lead author, Louise H nault-Ethier, carried out her research while pursuing a master s from what is now Concordia s Individualized program. She experimented with different methods of vermicomposting to see whether they could sufficiently inactivate certain bacteria for safe public use of the compost.   Centralized composting, which is one of the fastest growing industrial composting methods, has strict governmental guidelines, requiring thermal sanitation to prevent the survival of harmful bacteria,  she says. The guidelines require that the compost reaches and maintains a heat of 55 degrees Celsius over a period of three days in a self-heating process driven by decomposer microorganisms found in the compost.   But in our case, worms graze on the decomposer community, preventing the onset of high temperatures. We wanted to see if vermicomposting, which proceeds at room temperature could still get rid of harmful bacteria.  H nault-Ethier worked with Concordia chemistry professor Yves G linas and biology professor  Vincent Martin to examine the impact of vermicomposting on E. coli, a bacteria often found in fecal matter that can easily make its way into organic waste set to be composted.  They devised three experiments to monitor the presence of E. coli, testing whether the size of the batch of compost, the amount of naturally occurring compost microbes and the rate at which the compost was fed would affect the survival of the pathogen.  Time and again, the worms worked their magic and eventually produced compost that respected the regulatory bacterial count limits. When the normal compost microbes or worms were present, E. coli declined more rapidly. Without worms or with sterile compost, it took a little more time to get there.   \"We found that the compost batches take on average 18 to 21 days to decrease the E. coli to levels well below the legal limit,  explains G linas, who worked closely with H nault-Ethier to examine how the chemicals, such as Carbon, Nitrogen or sugars, present in the compost materials would affect the bacteria s survival.  While that's slower than traditional composting methods, it s not a prohibitive amount of time.\"  Upcycling waste  For H nault-Ethier, who was recently named head of scientific projects for the David Suzuki Foundation , it s the added benefits of vermicomposting that are most important, beyond the results of the E. coli survival experiments. \"The compost it produces may lead to higher plant yields when used as a fertilizer, and   even more surprising  the red wigglers themselves could then be reused as feed for other animals on the food chain,  she says. This is what's called  upcycling    generating something more valuable than the initial waste product. Although the idea of using invertebrates as animal feed may seem a little strange, it s actually a proven method for potentially replacing the resource-intensive soybeans or fish meal traditionally used.  \"This study suggests that upcycling technologies like vermicomposting can be more widely developed for commercial use,  says H nault-Ethier. As a past environmental coordinator for Concordia, she spearheaded a large-scale worm-farming project in which 15 tons of the university s waste were composted per year.  Though traditional compost can rapidly kill potential pathogens through heat, industrial composting may actually take longer to reach maturity than vermicomposting. Why not wait a little longer to see pathogen declines in vermicomposting and then create a product that provides nutrient-rich feed to both plants and animals? It's a win-win situation.\" The results show that vermicomposting is a promising method in the sanitation of organic waste, which would allow for producing proteins for animal feed. That said, while the E. coli inactivation observed in the current study is promising, H nault-Ethier cautions that further research on a more diverse array of pathogens is still required.

Held on November 12 and 13 in Pointe-Claire s Stewart Hall, the event offered close to 1,800 visitors the chance to participate in interactive scientific displays on topics ranging from the chemistry of ice cream to the effects of climate change on the planet.  We always like to say Exposcience is for children aged one to 90,  says Miriam Posner, manager of planning and academic facilities for the  Faculty of Arts and Science .  When you see the children s eyes light up as they explore the exhibitions, you really understand why we do this every year. It fosters a sense of fascination and promotes the value of community. It also demonstrates that Concordia is a leader when it comes to getting the next generation interested in science.     A wonderful outreach  Fellow organizer Cameron Tilson, assistant director in institutional planning and analysis, first became involved with Exposcience in 1984.  It represents a wonderful outreach to our community,  he says.  Our students are some of our best ambassadors. This event gives them an opportunity to talk about and demonstrate the work they are doing with members of the public.  Tilson adds that over the years he s spoken to numerous current and former Concordia students who insist that attending Exposcience was one of the reasons they entered their field of study and chose to attend the university.   Drones, dune buggies and electrocardiograms Every year, new exhibitions are offered, and this year was no exception. Audiences got to take in a display featuring a newly purchased drone from the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment . It streamed pictures taken by a multi-spectral camera, which captures image data at specific frequencies across the  electromagnetic spectrum . Meanwhile, the Department of Psychology s table featured three exhibitions: associate professor Jennifer McGrath showed individuals their heart beats using electrocardiograms; assistant professor Kristen Dunfield and her students demonstrated how developmental researchers approach testing in children, investigating issues such as the development of morality and theory of mind; and associate professor Aaron Johnson s display included a game of Where s Waldo to demonstrate eye tracking. The Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science also joined in the fun. The Concordia SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) display was once again a crowd favourite, allowing visitors to experience a rocky ride while strapped into a dune buggy. Meanwhile, students from the UAV Concordia (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) student society allowed visitors to examine Aerial technology up close.

Upon light absorption by the visual pigment of rod photoreceptors (rhodopsin), 11-cis-retinal is isomerised to all-trans-retinal. As a result, all-trans-retinal dissociates from opsin and is conveyed to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) where it is recycled to 11-cis-retinal through the  retinoids visual cycle . One of the key enzymes of the visual cycle in the RPE, lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), is responsible for the conversion of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinyl ester. LRAT is a membrane-associated protein. We have thus expressed a truncated LRAT (tLRAT, amino acids 31-196) without its N- and C-terminal  -helices. All essential amino acids for the catalytic activity of LRAT are present in tLRAT. The enzymatic reaction catalyzed by LRAT is postulated to take place in two steps. 1) Non-acylated LRAT first hydrolyzes the sn-1 fatty acyl chain of phospholipids, which results in the production of acylated LRAT. 2) Acylated LRAT then transfers its acyl chain to retinol, which produces a retinyl ester. We have recently developed the first reliable method to quantitatively determine the enzymatic activity of tLRAT, which allowed characterizing its biochemical properties in details. We found that tLRAT enzymatic activity is more than 55,000-fold larger than the highest activity reported for this enzyme. Then, the C161S/C168S-tLRAT mutant was prepared to eliminate acylation heterogeneity. We also prepared a uniformly 15N,13C-labeled C161S/C168S-tLRAT sample, and succeeded to assign 100% of backbone amides and 100% of the 13C , 13C  and 13C  by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). We derived the secondary structure of tLRAT based on the assigned chemical shifts. Moreover, several mutations of LRAT (Y61A-, A106T-, R109L-, P173L- and S175R) are leading to a complete loss of vision. These mutants have very little or no enzymatic activity. In addition, the comparison between our 15N-Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra of tLRAT and those of the P173L-, Y61A-, A106T- and S175R-tLRAT mutants allowed to suggest that these mutations result in local structural changes in the protein and that its global folding remains unchanged. The N- and C-terminal segments of LRAT have also been studied to determine their respective contribution to the membrane anchoring of LRAT. Furthermore, our membrane binding experiments with tLRAT suggested that it has a strong affinity for membranes despite the absence of its N- and C-terminal hydrophobic segments. Other regions of LRAT must be involved in its membrane anchoring such as an  -helical internal segment that we have identified from our NMR characterization.

As particles deposit onto the QCM sensor, an increase in mass on the surface results in a measurable decrease in the crystal s resonance frequency in accordance with the Sauerbrey model. QCM-D can thus be used to evaluate ENP deposition kinetics onto model aquifer grain surfaces over a broad range of environmentally relevant conditions. Furthermore, monitoring of dissipative energy losses induced by the deposited ENPs can provide information on their coupling with the surface as well as their size and surface orientation. Although QCM-D has been used to gain insight into the potential transport behavior of different ENPs in natural aquatic environments, a number of caveats exist in the interpretation of QCM-D measurements. For instance, positive frequency shifts have been reported which are counterintuitive to the principle of QCM-D as a mass sensor. In particular, the interpretation of QCM-D measurements for aggregated ENP systems has proven to be challenging. Consideration of the  coupled-resonance theory  for appropriate interpretation of such measurements will be discussed. We have also shown how QCM-D can be used to directly detect with great sensitivity the interactions of ENPs with supported lipid bilayers as model cell membranes and resulting bilayer disruption, which makes it a complementary tool for nanotoxicity studies. Taken together, this body of work demonstrates some of the potential applications and limitations of QCM-D in environmental nanoscience.

Abstract The aim of this work is to develop theoretical approaches to compute vibrational spectra beyond the harmonic approximation and to investigate the performance of the self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding model (SCC-DFTB) in studying the vibrational spectra of large systems. For this purpose, vibrational spectra of ion-water clusters and peptide-water clusters are computed from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the dipole moment (FTACF). The performance of the SCC-DFTB model is evaluated by comparing computed spectra with available experimental results and ab initio or first-principles results. There are four distinct aspects to this work: (1) To demonstrate how the FTACF approach overcomes the limitations of the harmonic approximation, vibrational spectra of the  Zundel ion , the protonated water dimer, are computed from ab initio MD simulations based on second-order M ller Plesset (MP2) Perturbation Theory. The splitting of the band of the proton transfer mode is well reproduced, and its coupling with other modes is characterized by examining the correlation spectra of a combination of selected internal coordinates. Computed spectra at different temperatures further confirm the ability of the approach to unveil temperature-dependent features of vibrational modes coupling. (2) To confirm the spectral signature of  free water  at the surface of aqueous droplets seeded by sulfate iosn proposed by experimentalists, theoretical vibrational spectra of sulfate-water clusters are generated using the SCC-DFTB model. Computed spectra not only reproduce the spectral signature of free surface water molecules, hence confirming the latter hypothesis, but also disclose the distance within which the sulfate ion may affect the structure and dynamics of water molecules in the gas phase, within the accuracy of the approximate model employed and the possible limitations of conformational sampling. (3) To investigate the hydration effect on the CN stretch band of the guanidinium ion, vibrational spectra of guanidinium-water clusters are obtained with the SCC-DFTB model. Computed spectra reveal a redshift in the band position, in agreement with ab initio calculations of harmonic frequencies. The SCC-DFTB spectra are also in good agreement with those obtained from Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) simulations employing more rigorous density-functional theory (DFT). (4) To validate the suitability of the approach to describe the interactions and dynamics of peptide-water binary systems, vibrational spectra of several model clusters containing prototype peptides are generated from MD simulations at different temperatures, with the ultimate goal of gaining insight into solvation effects on the spectra of hydrated proteins. Computed spectra are in excellent agreement with available experimental results and reported theoretical results. Altogether, these findings not only shed light onto understanding the properties of ion-water and peptide-water clusters, but also validate an efficient approach to compute vibrational spectra of large systems with satisfactory performance and accuracy.

These range from J.J. Thompson's discovery of the electron and the development of quantum theory to the determination of entire genomes and proteomics research.  Arguably one of the most interesting contributions that mass spectrometry has made is in the detailed understanding of the physical chemistry of noncovalently bound complex ions.  This includes the determination of thermochemistry, ion molecule reactivities, and ion structure.  In our lab, we use many mass spectrometric techniques such as collision induced dissociation (CID), ion molecule reactions, blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD), as well as the more direct infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy to determine ion structures and energetics of ion-molecule reactions. I will explain some of the techniques that we use in my laboratory to study the physical chemistry of non-covalent cluster ions using examples such as metal ion bound complexes of uracil, metal ion nucleated guanine tetrads and quadruplexes, and if time permits, halogen bonded complexes.

Abstract O6-Alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferases (AGTs) are responsible for genomic maintenance by repairing O6-alkyl-2 -deoxyguanosine (O6-alkyl-dG) and O4-alkyl-thymidine (O4-alkyl-dT) adducts. AGT-mediated repair was investigated against O4-alkyl-dT mono-adducts and DNA intrastrand cross-links (IaCL). First, a bicyclic pyrimidine linking the C5-atom to the O4-atom, by an ethylene or a propylene bridge, were synthesized as conformationally locked mimics of the biologically relevant DNA damage O4-methyl thymidine (O4-MedT) and O4-ethyl thymidine (O4-EtdT), respectively. Once incorporated in DNA oligomers by solid-phase synthesis, biophysical characterization by UV thermal denaturation and circular dichroism of duplexes containing the modifications revealed minimal differences between O4-MedT and O4-EtdT inserts and their respective bicyclic mimics. These adducts evaded repair by the AGT homologues from human (hAGT), and E. coli (OGT and Ada-C) providing insights on the conformational requirements of repair of O4-alkyl-dT lesions. Second, a variety of cross-linked dimers linking the O6-atom of 2'-deoxyguanosine or O4-atom of thymidine were prepared synthetically to produce precursors for IaCL DNA that either lack or containing an intradimer phosphodiester group in the oligonucleotide backbone. The modifications were introduced in DNA sequences using solid phase synthesis and studies revealed a similar decrease in thermal stability across all IaCL-containing duplexes relative to control duplexes. The presence of the IaCL, and mimics thereof, minimally perturb the global structures of the duplexes, as assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and basic molecular modeling (geometrical optimization). Studies with AGTs demonstrated that: 1) O6-2 -deoxyguanosine-alkylene-O6-2 -deoxyguanosine (O6-dG-alkylene-O6-dG) flexible IaCL DNA (lacking the phosphodiester linkage) were repaired by hAGT, with faster repair occurring with the heptylene analogue. Repair of the model IaCL DNA occurred more efficiently in comparison to similar ICL DNA; 2) O6-dG-alkylene-O6-dG IaCL DNA containing the intradimer phosphodiester were moderately repaired by hAGT, with faster repair also occurring with the heptylene analogue. Efficiency of ther hAGT-mediated repair was contingent on the presence of the intradimer phosphate, which suggest conformational flexibility may be a requirement for repair by AGTs; 3) Flexible O4-thymidine-alkylene-O4-thymidine (O4-dT-alkylene-O4-dT) IaCL DNA evaded repair from all AGTs tested, whereas the flexible IaCL 5'-O4-dT-alkylene-O6-dG were efficiently repaired by hAGT. Interestingly, the 5'-O6-dG-alkylene-O4-dT was not proficiently repaired by hAGT supporting the importance of the 3'-phosphate group of the target dG nucleotide. 4) Flexible IaCL can be employed to generate DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs), with good conversions, as observed with repair of O6-dG-alkylene-O6-dG and 5'-O4-dT-alkylene-O6-dG by hAGT. The use of such cross-linking experiments may be useful for elucidating substrate discrimination across AGTs by X-ray crystallography. Translesion synthesis (TLS) may be activated by the cell as a coping mechanism when DNA damage evades repair or remains otherwise irreparable by repair mechanisms. DNA polymerase (Pol) enzymes display varying substrate promiscuity and processivity depending a on a number of factors such as the chemical nature of the DNA lesion. Human DNA polymerase   (hPol  ) is a key TLS Pol involved in the bypass of certain UV-induced DNA damage, and lesions formed by platinum-containing chemotherapeutics. Bypass experiments were conducted to determine if conformational freedom of the lesion impacted hPol   processivity: 1) The conformationally locked pyrimidyl analogues described above were bypassed by hPol   with different profiles, relative to O4-MedT and O4-EtdT. All thymidinyl modifications evoked an error-prone behavior from hPol  , with insertion of dGMP being incorporated most-frequently in the growing strand. 2) IaCL bypass profiles of O6-dG-alkylene-O6-dG containing the intradimer phosphodiester group behaved significantly different relative to those IaCL lacking it. hPol   inserted the correct nucleotide (dCMP) across the 3'-dG residue for all IaCL studied, whereas an error-prone behavior was observed across the 5'-dG residue. While the lack of the intradimer phosphodiester caused frameshift adduct formation across the 5'-dG, hPol   inserted the incorrect dTMP across the 5'-dG of the canonical IaCL DNA. More studies are required to elucidate whether this dependence is shared for other types of lesions. Where Room SP 265.29, Richard J.

Herein, we report the anionic polymerization of allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) on methoxy-PEG (mPEG) as macroinitiator to produce the diblock copolymer mPEG-b-PAGE. The mPEG-b-PAGE copolymer was then used as a common precursor to generate a systematic series of copolymers derivatized with pendant alkyl chains via thiolene click chemistry. These amphiphilic block copolymers were found to self-assemble in aqueous solution to form aggregates with distinct and unique morphologies. Depending on the hydrophobic weight fraction of the copolymer, spheres, long filomicelles, rods, disks and polymersomes with confirmed biocompatibility were formed. These materials were evaluated in terms of ability to solubilize the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). For each copolymer, stable micelle formulations were prepared that included high DOX to copolymer ratios of up to 20 % (wt%) with drug loading efficiencies > 60 % (w/w). In vitro drug release studies, conducted under physiologically relevant conditions, revealed sustained release profiles.
