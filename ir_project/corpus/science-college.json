These research projects allow students to acquire first-hand scientific experience. The research may be carried out with scientists at Concordia or at some other university or research institution. In recent years, students have completed projects at universities like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Rochester, Frankfurt, Freiberg, Paris, Berlin, Innsbruck, San Diego, Johns Hopkins, London University, England, Simon Fraser University, Barbados, Miami and others. The work of the student is supervised and graded either by a faculty member or by an academically qualified person at the outside institution.  An attractive aspect of this program is that students are expected to participate in research projects outside their field. One can find a physics student doing experiments in neurophysiology, or a biology student participating in a computer project. This program is the core of our curriculum and is unique in Canada. Students are not just doing laboratory exercises. They are active and interested participants in the resolution of current scientific problems. This role both sharpens their understanding of science and gives them first-hand experience with what to expect from a scientific career. It has been our experience that the most interested and motivated students would rather do the research than view it from a distance. The college has its own library. ", "title": "Research"},

After the lecture there is also an opportunity for audience members to meet the speaker on the premises of the Science College at a reception organized by the students. The audience consists of students, academics and mainly interested members of the public. Upcoming lectures A SINGULARLY UNFEMININE PROFESSION: ONE WOMAN S JOURNEY IN PHYSICS BY MARY K. GAILLARD Mary K. Gaillard will recount some of her experiences as a woman in a male-dominated field. She was unprepared for the various difficulties she encountered at Columbia University, in Paris and at the particle physics laboratory CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland before joining the Berkley Physics faculty as its first woman member. She will describe in depth the physics developments that she witnessed and participated in dynamic period of its inception, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These developments led to the Standard Model of particle Physics. The Standard Model has been confirmed by experiments, culminating in the discovery of the Higgs particle physics in 2012. She will give some vivid reflections on the current status of women in physics today and most importantly on the future of the field. The Science College is part of Concordia University.

The College is for students who: are enrolled in one of Concordia University's science programs; show a greater interest in and ability for science than the average students; and, are highly motivated and want to prepare for a life of research, teaching or an equally demanding intellectual pursuit. The College is a place where students share a physical space, a building, desks, and computers. It also provides an opportunity for students to get together over lunch. The atmosphere is science   whether it be wrestling with a problem together, talking with a teacher, or proposing a new idea for discussion. This type of social interaction is an all-important factor in the life of scientists   who spend a lot of their career interacting with others in the field   and is the best way to gain a real understanding of scientific problems. Students are encouraged to think for themselves, to help each other, and to learn from each other. All are seen as essential ingredients of an education. Our  research  component is unique in Canada.

A group of Concordia University professors headed by Dr. Elaine Newman got together and formulated the following principles: Science is a system of thought and not a collection of facts; therefore students should be thoroughly introduced to that system of thought. Science does not exist in a void, but forms part of the human tradition. Students should see it in that light. Science education is traditionally compartmentalized into departments, but science itself crosses those borders. The Science College must have an encouraging and noncompetitive atmosphere and style. The elements of the Science College were chosen with these principles in mind. Students are involved in actual research for their entire stay at the College. Students do at least 6 credits in the history and philosophy of science. Students take interdisciplinary courses designed specifically for them. A document embodying all the above mentioned facts was presented to the Arts and Science faculty council and then to the Concordia University Senate. It was approved on April 27, 1979. To publicize the new college, the Science College  public lectures  were created, and they are still one of the major public events of the Science College. As the years have passed there has been a greater demand for this type of programme and the College has grown. In 1979, there were 12 students compared to over 80 currently. But this number is still quite small and with good reason. Small numbers make for an intense learning experience where students get to know and work with each other, question the status quo, get an overview of science as a whole and participate in cutting edge research in three different areas during their tenure. The result is that Science College alumni can be found in top positions in science and medicine, both in Canada and abroad. Contact us Science College: 514-848-2424 ext. 2595 ", "title": "History"},

On November 26, Concordia hosts the 2016 ReMixEd  unconference  for educators Posted on November 23, 2016 | By: Chris Colley When is a conference not a conference? That s a question LEARN Quebec hopes to answer when it brings educators together to remix their experience and expertise on Saturday, November 26. Dubbed an  unconference,  the event is free and open to teachers, pre-service teachers, administrators, education professionals and anyone who is interested in the field. It is being held in partnership with Concordia s Faculty of Arts and Science and Department of Education . LEARN is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving minority communities in Quebec s education sector, from Anglophone and Indigenous language groups to those working in both youth and adult education. The group first put the unconference concept into practice last year, when they organized an edcamp at McGill University with some of its local partners. Welcome to the unconference! The basic idea of an edcamp is straightforward: no pre-organized sessions, no keynotes, no agenda, no pre-determined topics or themes. Participants will build the agenda on the morning of the event. In essence, the day is designed by the educators attending. It s the first time LEARN will host an edcamp at Concordia   a collaboration made possible through the support of Andr  Roy , dean of Arts and Science; Richard Schmid , chair of the Education Department; and his departmental colleagues Giuliana Cucinelli and Ann-Louise Davidson . The magic of an unconference lies in its simplicity. Attendees are asked to follow just two rules: be selfish and don t break out that PowerPoint! If a session is not giving you what you need, organizers recommend you get up and find one that does. Even better, post a session topic that you re interested in discussing on the communal agenda. Because the intent is to be unstructured, letting ideas flow freely through engaging conversation, being shackled to your favourite PowerPoint presentation as you stand at the front of the room is discouraged. An emphasis on accessibility ReMixEd Camp MTL 2016 will offer some traditional edcamp sessions, but as the title implies, they also plan to shake things up. This year will include an all-day maker space  as well as something called an  app smash.  Participants will be invited to show a crowd in 60 seconds how they use a given app in their classroom. And of course, there will be prizes! Educational products including apps, iPad cases, document cameras, stickers, posters and tablets are all up for grabs. In keeping with the event s mandate of accessibility, attendees will also be able to visit the  energy table  for snacks and drinks and free child care is offered. Above all else, organizers aim to make the day welcoming to all   whether you re already an educator or are soon to be one. Chris Colley is a pedagogical consultant, LEARN member and ReMixEd Camp MTL co-organizer. ReMixEd Camp MTL 2016 takes place at Concordia from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, November 26 in room 1.210 of the John Molson (MB) Building (1450 Guy Street).  Register for the event today!

Latimer Catherine Bolton:  Our community has a huge amount to teach us.  | Photo by David Ward Whether it s archaeology, urban design or pastoral ministry, Concordia offers an array of courses that send students off campus. The goal? To encourage in-person collaboration with local businesses and community associations and provide unique learning experiences.  To date, we offer 168 designated  CBEL  courses, meaning community-based experiential learning ,  says Catherine Bolton , Concordia s vice-provost of Teaching and Learning.  Citizenship involves being aware of your community and working with it. These courses are tremendously effective ways to train students to think rationally and critically.  Bolton credits the Living Knowledge research project, funded by the Office of Community Engagement (OCE), for creating the online directory of 168 CBEL courses , organized by faculty. The project reflects at least three of Concordia s Strategic Directions: Embrace the City, Embrace the World , Teach for Tomorrow and Get Your Hands Dirty .  These findings helped us to identify the extended CBEL community. The list is a living document and we hope to populate it with more courses,  says Bolton.  Sometimes, there's a professor doing CBEL and we just don't know because the course description is generic. So, we're looking to have professors help inform us and figure out how we can build more relationships   supporting our university s development, our students and the community at the same time.  Students take the lead Raymond Paquin , for one, tries to incorporate CBEL into as many of his management courses at the John Molson School of Business as possible, including the popular  MANA 369 - Business and Sustainability.\"  I don't send students to specific companies. Instead, I encourage them to go into the community and look around   to think of the places they frequent and how they can become involved,,  says Paquin.  What they need is to think about what's practical, given time constraints   the students have nine weeks   and the potential for actual change. This often means working with small organizations and those that are willing.  Recently, several students in Paquin s course had an ambitious idea: to retrofit their apartment building s lighting system. They did a full analysis, with recommendations and planning, then presented it to their property manager. The project was accepted and construction began immediately.  Not everyone is guaranteed such a  light-bulb  moment,  says Paquin.  However, many times there are enough light bulbs, meaning examples of real impact, in the class that the students who didn't get their own  ah-ha moment  can sense the possibilities and still benefit.   We need to respect what our community needs  CBEL opportunities exist across Concordia s three other faculties too, from the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science  s  SOEN 490 - Capstone software engineering design\" to the Faculty of Arts and Science  s  URBS 333 - Urban Laboratory\" to  DART 453 - Design and Community Engagement\" in the Faculty of Fine Arts . One of the things Bolton learned while talking to people involved in CBEL is the importance of reciprocity.  We need to respect our community and what they need if we want to go into their world,  she says.  It can't be a one-way street. They're not a laboratory. They have a huge amount to teach us.  Bolton notes that the OCE is working on finding more community partners and developing a list of potential future collaborators.  Ultimately, we want to establish long-term relationships,  says Bolton.  If faculty members are interested in learning more about how to incorporate CBEL into their courses, contact Rob Cassidy at the Centre for Teaching and Learning and contact the OCE.

For $12, you get much more than a plate of pasta. It also includes a green salad, a roll, a drink and a dessert   chocolate or vanilla cake. The food is being donated, so all proceeds go directly to Centraide. Social justice activists at COCo Curious about what kinds of organizations receive funding from your donations? The Centre for Community Organizations (COCo) is just one of the 349 agencies and projects that benefit from Concordia s fundraising efforts on behalf of the Centraide of Greater Montreal campaign, which raised $54.3 million in 2015. COCo is a provincial, non-profit organization that promotes social justice, active citizenship, democracy and just socio-economic development by supporting healthy organizations and strong communities through education.   Centraide was pivotal as our first source of core funding in 2001 and they ve been with us ever since,  says COCo co-founder and Concordia alum Frances Ravensbergen (PhD 10). She is now a part-time faculty member in both the School of Community and Public Affairs and the Department of Applied Human Sciences at Concordia.  They approached us, which was remarkable. In my 30 years in the field of community development, I d never seen funders make the first move.  Centraide gives COCo $95,400 a year in core funding   one third of their operating budget. COCo s horizontal organization is run by a four-person team. It often works with Concordia groups, such as the Quebec English-Speaking Communities Research Network run by Lorraine O' Donnell , affiliate professor with Concordia s School of Community and Public Affairs .  Essentially, we are a second-line organization,  says Juniper Belshaw, currently a master s student at Concordia in Human Systems Intervention (HSI) , who handles COCo s funding development and contract coordination.  We support community organizations that deal with individual citizens.  Concordia s real-world connection Belshaw credits the education she s getting in Concordia s master s program in HSI for  everything,  including changing the way she thinks about organizations.  Before the program, I thought about each individual s role. Now, I think about all the moving parts of an organization and I have a more profound understanding of the difficulties of change.  Ravensbergen also acknowledges the impact Concordia has had on her work.  I was already working in community development when I started my undergraduate degree at Concordia in the 1980s,  she recalls.  But the way the university connected to the real world helped me to link the theoretical pieces to what I was dealing with on the job.  Both Ravensbergen and Belshaw praise Centraide s understanding of what it takes to help community organizations.  Centraide has a holistic vision of what is needed to create social change,  said Ravensbergen. Email unitedway@concordia.ca to buy your raffle or 50/50 tickets before 4:20 p.m. on December 5, 2016!

Admission to the College is by personal interview only. In addition to their Major, members of the Science College are enrolled in a Minor in Multidisciplinary Studies in Science. Our enrolment has increased from 12 students in 1979 to the current number of 70 students. The College accepts 20 to 30 students every year. Criteria of eligibility The criteria for eligibility necessitates that the applicant to apply to the Science College, must be enrolled in one of the Natural science programmes, namely: Biology, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Computer Science, Exercise Science, Geography, Journalism, Physics, Psychology (B.Sc. or B.A. in Cognitive Science), and Mathematics but Actuarial Mathematics is excluded. The interview Students are granted an interview if the student is accepted at Concordia University. The personal interview is the key determinant for acceptance to the college. To be accepted students must possess a good academic background in natural sciences and excellent grades and complementary involvement outside the academic field. Other considerations When an individual applies to the college, first the grades are evaluated and a decision is made whether to grant that individual an interview. The personal interview dictates one s acceptance to the college. Consequently, student s exhibits exceptional motivation and aptitude but those whose performance at the interview supersede their ability to obtain excellent grades are accepted to the college. Many of these students evolve as amongst the college s best achievers. When one applies to the Science College, one's grades are looked at and taken into account, however, large emphasis is placed on the personal interview. Hence, students who show exceptional motivation and capacity, but for some reason were not successful in obtaining the best grades can be accepted. Many of these students turn out to be among the College's high achievers. Each student is sent a letter after the interview and, if accepted, confirmation must be sent to the College.

Celtic Soul follows Hancox s old buddy, Hollywood star and fellow Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce (N.D.G.) neighbourhood homeboy Jay Baruchel, on an epic road trip through Canada, Ireland and Scotland with Baruchel s new friend, renowned Irish soccer journalist Eoin O Callaghan. Montreal-raised filmmaker Aaron Hancox says he misses his days in Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce. | Photo courtesy Aaron Hancox Yet when people meet Hancox they are curious about his very first film, Cinema L Amour, about the famous Montreal porn theatre of the same name. That film won Best Short Documentary at the 2007 Montreal World Film Festival (MWFF).  The first time I walked into Cinema L Amour I was a 20-year-old Concordia student, and I had no idea this theatre was an architectural gem,  says Hancox.  I had heard the legend of magician Harry Houdini being fatally punched there   which wasn t true   but it is an odd place that serves a special niche.  The film helped propel his career.  It is a film people still ask me about. I think people will go see a film about a porn theatre even if it s a bad film, to be honest. So I don t know how much credit I can take for making a good film!  Hancox says.  But to have my film win at the MWFF was amazing, especially for it do so well as a student film. I was proud of the film, it got a lot of attention, and several years later it was actually screened in Cinema L Amour during Nuit Blanche in front of a packed house, which was the greatest accomplishment! It was full circle for me.  Jay Baruchel goes on road trip to Ireland and Scotland in Celtic Soul. | Photo courtesy Markham Street Films After working as a television editor and director of photography, Hancox joined the Toronto-based Markham Street Films as their director of Sales and Development in 2010. Today he is the company s vice-president, Unscripted, and produced their 2014 feature doc David & Me about the wrongful murder conviction of David McCallum, a film that helped exonerate McCallum after 29 years in prison.  I want to be humble about this because I was one of many people who helped free David McCallum. I was one small part in getting this film made,  says Hancox.  David was the biggest part, his resilience, his hope and belief in his innocence. It was the best moment of my career, and may be the best moment of my life, being there the day David walked out of jail.  Fortunate friendship Hancox s new film, Celtic Soul, came to him unsolicited.  Jay and I are actually old high school friends from N.D.G. We went to FACE school together in the  90s, were in a band and had this great friendship,  Hancox explains.  We hadn t been in touch for a few years and, believe it or not, that relationship had nothing to do with the genesis of this film. It was just a great coincidence that the film was brought to us by a mutual friend, Eoin O Callaghan, who said they had cooked up this idea for a documentary,  he says.  As it turned, I was an old friend of Jay s   that was a really nice bonus. The film is very rock and roll: It is able to walk this fine line between fart jokes and a really heartfelt story about friendship, immigration and the Irish plight, and how sport can be a force for good.  Celtic Soul premieres at the Hot Docs Ted Rogers Cinema in Toronto on November 25, 2016, with Baruchel and O Callaghan in attendance. Now based in Toronto, Hancox recalls growing up in N.D.G.  I miss Chalet Bar-B-Q, Spurs country bar, Supermarch  Akhavan and the Rose Bowl, and I miss Honey Martin, where I used to play with my former band The Future Ex-Wives every Thursday night,  says Hancox.  Much like Jay, I like to say that I m from N.D.G. before I say Montreal.  Hancox adds that his time at Concordia was vital in shaping his career.  Concordia was crucial and informative,  he says.  Quite simply, I learned how to make films at Concordia, and to make media responsibly. I realize I truly have the privilege and position to tell important stories.

The PhD student triumphed at the 2016 Quebec Writers' Federation Awards Posted on November 23, 2016 | By: Tom Peacock EDITOR'S NOTE: This story was updated on Wednesday, November 23. Kelly Norah Drukker s first collection of poems, Small Fires , (McGill-Queen s University Press, 2016) has won the Concordia University First Book Prize and the A.M. Klein Prize for Poetry. The awards were presented at the annual Quebec Writers' Federation (QWF) Awards Gala this Tuesday, November 22, at the Corona Theatre. Drukker's poems had already earned her a CBC Literary Award and a Norma Epstein Foundation Award in Creative Writing. She was also a finalist for the 2016  Grand Prix du livre de Montr al . Her work has appeared in The Malahat Review and enRoute , among other places. Currently, Drukker is pursuing a PhD in humanities at Concordia. Her poem,  Niamh,  is from the first section of Small Fires. It s set on Inis M r, the largest of the three Aran Islands, off the west coast of County Galway, Ireland.   You go down deep.  Touch the white pelt of winter ocean, stroke the sand that rolls like bear fur, white-edged softness of loosed minerals.  Hair from the shore, seaweed bands cold mouths around your burnt and salted skin. You swim every winter s day; the ocean calls your feet to make their way to the violet mouth of foam and periwinkles.  You feel them, clipped and silvered under the ocean s shell, for cold makes us immune to slights and slivers.  A sliced toe on beach glass blooms to anemones beneath the ocean s skin, four months of slicing open winter s white-capped belly, sliding in.  Once I saw you swim, an otter or a winter bear, and stopped myself, for why does woman become some other animal when she enters winter water, hair curly and gold-tipped with salt and frost?  Niamh, you move slowly, shoulders rounded, fleshy pink.  If I painted you another way, if I only said you lived alone, cuticles raw with coal dust, I d be forcing emptiness into your days that isn t there for the ocean s mouth, barbed with blue, and sea grass moving soundlessly across your feet receive you: free of flesh and time, swimming out to meet the waves as all sea creatures do.

Much analysis of this phenomenon looks at the socio-economic, cultural or psychological reasons why young people in particular are susceptible. Andr  Gagn :  Scholars need to speak up.  But what role does religious thinking play? This question is the central theme of The Global Impact of Religious Violence (Wipf and Stock, 2016), a new book of essays co-edited by Andr  Gagn  , associate professor in the Department of Theological Studies in the Faculty of Arts and Science , and PhD candidates Spyridon Loumakis and Calogero Miceli. The collection includes contributions from eight Concordia graduate students from various departments such as Religion, Theological Studies, Psychology and English. Some of the topics covered in the book include the role of religious violence in the Rwandan genocide; religious violence and animal sacrifice; representations of religion and violence in comic books after 9/11, and religious versus state violence. We sat down with Gagn  to try to unpack the thorny issue of religion and violent extremism. How did this book come about? Andr  Gagn : It is the direct result of a conference on the topic held at Concordia back in 2015. We invited Iowa State University professor Hector Avalos , an expert on religious violence who is also one of the book s contributors. With acts of extremism rising in the world we felt it necessary to engage with this topic. When a violent attack occurs, news agencies normally interview government officials, sociologists or political analysts. Rarely do we hear from people specializing in religion or theological studies. But we should, because those who perpetrate these atrocities use religious rhetoric to legitimize their actions. Certainly disenfranchisement, poverty and marginalization play a role, but there is definitely also a religious angle that needs to be explored. Why do you think religion has been largely absent from the dialogue concerning radicalization? AG: It s a sensitive topic because when you talk about religion you talk about people s identities. Unfortunately these days, religious violence is associated with Islam and Muslims. And that is why people are very careful in the way they speak about religion and violence. What we try to show in the book is that religion has a lot of different manifestations. Whether it s the Bible or the Qur an, there are many good aspects, such as the practice of certain ethical precepts. However, in these same texts there are darker sides, where God commands the extermination of enemies, for example.  Many religious groups manage to not read these texts literally and understand them from another perspective or context. But there are groups that refuse to interpret them symbolically and instead take them word for word. Salafists are a minority   a sub-group   of Islam which we cannot completely disassociate from the religion itself. Even within salafism there are sub-groups   some more peaceful than others   which all claim to represent Islam. It s the same thing when it comes to Christian fundamentalists. We wouldn t say they are not Christians, but they in no way represent all of Christianity. In the book, we look at various traditions to examine the global impact of religious violence. We address religious traditions across different geographical locations and how religious violence manifests itself not only in the Middle East, but in Africa, Europe and North America.  Is there a common thread that links religious extremism around the world? AG: The thread is the way we define religion. It is a way of life and thought that presupposes the existence of and relationship with unverifiable forces and beings. When an unempirical entity whose existence cannot be verified commands someone to act violently then this becomes an ethical problem. This is why scholars need to speak up.  In the essay that you contribute to the book, you talk about the tyranny of political correctness when it comes to talking about religion and extremism. What do you mean by this?  AG: We really cannot put everybody in the same basket. In the case of Islam, it is clear that most Muslims are not violent. This is why people are sometimes afraid that Muslims will be marginalized when Islam is mentioned in the context of violence. We hear things like  ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.  But at the same time, ISIS justifies its own violent actions by de-contextualizing passages from the Qur an or from the life of Muhammad. Who are we to say from the outside that this has nothing to do with religion, when those committing violent acts tell us it does? Isn t it some sort of intellectual colonialism when we attribute motivations to others that are contrary to what they are telling us? How can examining religion in the context of extremism help to reduce radicalization? AG: It all comes down to education. We need to specifically teach what is meant by religious extremism and how it can sometimes lead to violence, and not make generalizations. I think this starts in high school. Young people need to be religiously literate   not through faith-based literacy, but by acquiring a better understanding of religious beliefs and practices from a historical and comparative perspective. We think that religion is this archaic thing but it s always going to be there. Therefore, our goal should be to educate and develop critical thinking in relation to all religious traditions.  A book launch for The Global Impact of Religious Violence will take place at the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies on Wednesday, November 30 from 12 to 1:30 p.m. in FB-804, Faubourg Building, 1250 Guy Street.

[PubMed] [Content] Biography Dave Mumby received his Ph.D. in Biopsychology from the University of British Columbia in 1992. In 1994, after 18 months in a postdoctoral research position in Dr. Robert Sutherland's laboratory at the University of New Mexico, Dr. Mumby joined the Department of Psychology at Concordia University. In 1999 he joined the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology. Fun fact I have chickens at home, and I'm thinking of ways to formally test their memory abilities. Seriously. Research Object recognition, spatial memory, fear learning, context memory, neural systems Overview: My interests broadly include animal cognition, and the analysis and development of methods and procedures for assessing various types of memory in rodents. For example, some of our recent studies revealed concerns about the internal validity of a widely-used novel-object preference test of object-recognition memory. We are now developing a new and improved object-recognition task. We also study spatial memory, fear learning, memory for contextual information, and the modulation of memory by contextual cues. We employ an array of behavioral paradigms to assess different aspects of memory, including water-maze, t-maze, radial-arm maze, and open-field tests of spatial memory, novel-object preference and delayed nonmatching-to-sample tests of object recognition, shock-probe fear learning, predator avoidance, and social transmission of food preferences. Additional interests include the anatomy of memory systems underlying object-recognition and spatial memory. We occasionally conduct studies to assess these abilities in rats with surgical lesions of specific brain areas. Past studies have focused mainly on hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, amygdala, intralaminar and midline thalamus. To develop their reputations as independent researchers, my graduate students are encouraged to pursue lines of inquiry they can call their own. The main requirements for a suitable research plan are: 1) the questions must be timely and important to behavioural neuroscientists, 2) we must have the financial and physical resources to conduct the research, and 3) we must have expertise with the required behavioural tests. Recent Ph.D. students did dissertation research on a rat model of schizophrenia, and the modulatory effects of estrogen on object-recognition memory. Funding My research is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). Lab members An up-to-date list of lab members can be found at my lab website.

Biography Jim Pfaus received his Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of British Columbia in 1990 under the direction of Drs. Anthony G. Phillips and H. Christian Fibiger. Following postdoctoral training in molecular biology and behavior with Dr. Donald Pfaff at the Rockefeller University (1990-1992), he joined the Department of Psychology and the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia University where he is a full professor. Jim was the 1995 recipient of the Frank A. Beach Award from the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology, and in 1997 was inducted into the International Academy of Sex Research. He received the Frank A. Beach Comparative Psychology Award from the American Psychological Association in 2009, the Sandra Lieblum Lectureship from the International Society for Sexual Medicine in 2011, the Herbert Thomas Award from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in 2012, the Concordia University Research Award in 2013, and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality in 2014. He was made a fellow (IF) of the International Society for the Study of Women s Sexual Health (ISSWSH) and a Concordia Research Fellow, both in 2013.  Jim serves on the Standards Committee of the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM), on the Board of Directors of ISSWSH, and is the current President-Elect of the International Academy of Sex Research (IASR). Jim is an associate editor of the Journal of Sexual Medicine and Sexual Medicine Reviews, section editor for preclinical research and psychophysiology for Current Sexual Health Reports, and serves on the editorial boards of the Behavioral Neuroscience, Hormones and Behavior, and Physiology and Behavior. He is also an associate editor of the APA Handbook of Psychology and Sexuality. At Concordia, Jim serves as Chair of the Human Research Ethics Committee, Vice-Chair of the Animal Research Ethics Committee, and is a Fellow of Concordia s Science College.  He is cross-appointed in the graduate programs of Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Exercise Science. Fun fact Jim s son Josh (age 12) is an amazing violin and hockey player.

[PubMed] [Content] Research Drug and Alcohol Abuse, Relapse, Neuropharmacology, Pavlovian conditioning, Optogenetics Overview: Fundamental learning processes like Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning play a central role in the use, misuse and abuse of psychoactive substances like alcohol. In my laboratory, we use preclinical models in rats to study psychological processes and neurobiological systems that regulate drug-seeking behaviours and relapse. Neuroscientific techniques include neuropharmacology, in-vivo optogenetics, chemogenetics, in-vitro electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We are currently pursing three exciting research directions that probe the central hypothesis that environmental stimuli that become associated with alcohol help to maintain alcohol use and trigger relapse. Project 1 seeks to identify neural processes that are needed for the expression of alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Project 2 investigates brain mechanisms that mediate the inhibition or extinction of responding to Pavlovian cues that occurs when a cue is no longer followed by an expected event. Project 3 examines the effect of nicotine, the main active ingredient in tobacco, on alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Translational studies are also underway to test the utility of compounds that act on the cholinergic system in the brain in preventing relapse to alcohol seeking behaviour. Through this research, we hope to expand our understanding of how drug abuse develops and inform new treatments for dependence and addiction.

This process uses inexhaustible resources, such as sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide and provides an example of a unique natural biocatalyst. Thorough understanding of the natural solar energy conversion is essential in the process of developing artificial energy converters for sustainable future energy production. The reactions leading to the energy conversion and storage take place in specially organized membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes, termed reaction centers. The energy conversion in these enzymes is secured primarily trough transporting electrons and protons across their natural membranes. We are particularly interested in the link between the light-induced electron transfer and the accompanying protonational reactions occurring in these centers during the early stage of the energy conversion process. We use an interdisciplinary approach to detect and modify these reactions that can connect concepts from physics, chemistry and biology. We grow and harvest photosynthetic organisms, isolate and purify the reaction center protein. The membrane environment of the isolated proteins is systematically altered in order to maximize the efficiency of the electron and proton transfer reactions. The biophysical characterization involves transient and steady state optical spectroscopy to determine the kinetics of the individual reaction steps from nanoseconds to minutes time scale and dual polarization interferometry to follow the conformational rearrangement of the protein in real time and in atomic resolution. Why study photosynthesis? Nature's photosynthetic process has been the primary solar energy conversion on Earth for 3.5 billion years and has a great potential to inspire the development of man-made solar energy converters.

Prior to this he held his first post doctoral fellowship at the August Krogh Institute, University of Copenhagen (Denmark), where he also taught in the Department of Cell Biology. He received a PhD in Medical Physiology from Lund University (Sweden) and has a strong background in molecular biology and protein chemistry after studies at the Lund Institute of Technology, Lund University (MSc., Chemical Engineering). Education PhD (Lund University), MSc (Lund University) Research interests The main research interests in Dr Bergdahl s lab lies in studies of the blood vessel wall with a focus on understanding this system during physiologically stressful situations like exercise as well as pathophysiological conditions. The differentiation and functional properties of smooth muscle cells depend on the cellular environment, and any disturbance of this, such as endothelial damage, inflammation or lipid retention will lead to reactions that can initiate atherosclerotic lesions. Dr Bergdahl study mechanisms involved in these processes by using state-of-the-art techniques including electrophysiology, isometric force measurements, functional proteomics, molecular genetics and advanced imaging. The overriding goal is to define conditions that are essential for the normal function and cell differentiation in the vascular wall and to translate these findings from the basic understanding and experimental animal research into clinical understanding of integrative cardiovascular control in health and disease. This is hoped to generate new therapeutic approaches which in the future might lead to better prevention of vascular disease. Teaching activities ", "title": "Faculty"},

However,environments undergo both short and long term changes resulting from a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures, leading to increased uncertainty (the incomplete or imperfect information regarding local conditions) among prey animals. A major challenge for ecologists is to determine how prey can balance these conflicts when faced with ecological uncertainty. Given that the combined effects of global climate change, invasive species and anthropogenic habitat degradation are expected to dramatically alter environments, the need to explore the effects of ecological uncertainty is key. As a cognitive and behavioural ecologist, I examine  how aquatic prey use public information to adjust behavioural trade-offs to current environmental conditions . Recently, I have focussed on neophobic predator recognition as an inducible response to elevated predation risk. However, mean predation risk is only one of many determinants of the ecological uncertainty experienced by prey. My long term objective for the next five years is to address the key question of how ecological uncertainty shapes the expression of neophobic predator avoidance and foraging patterns of prey and what are the cognitive cost associated with neophobia.

This includes an in depth molecular analysis of anillin, a conserved actin and myosin binding protein that is a key component of the contractile ring required for cytokinesis. A future goal will be the identification of novel  regulators of actin-myosin assembly and contraction in nonmuscle cells. This work  is being done on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and in mammalian cells.

This view changed in the early 1950 s, when the study of a few patients who became profoundly amnesic following bilateral damage to the medial structures of the temporal lobe pointed to the importance of the hippocampal region for autobiographical memory. This work also provided early evidence for the existence of multiple memory systems in the brain.

However, little attention has been devoted to its origins and its theoretical status with respect to physics and especially to quantum mechanics, which is generally supposed to explain it fully. The lecture will draw on the author s recent prize-winning book, The Periodic Table, Its Story and Its Significance, in an attempt to redress this imbalance. Topics will include the precursors of the periodic table, its six independent discoverers, and its impact on modern physics including the discovery of the electron, radioactivity and isotopes as well as theoretical approaches due to Bohr, Pauli, Schr dinger and others. The lecture will conclude with some thoughts on whether there might be an  optimal form  of the periodic table and what this might look like. THE SPEAKER: Eric Scerri is originally from Malta. He obtained all his degrees in the UK. His Bachelors and Masters degrees were in chemistry from the Universities of London and Southampton. His Ph.D was in history and philosophy of science from Kings College, London. He went to the US as a postdoctoral fellow at Caltech fifteen years ago and has remained in the US ever since. For the past 10 years he has been teaching chemistry and philosophy of science at the University of California at Los Angeles.

Many rules of physics that apply in a real scene are, however, optional in a painting. The artist can choose transgressions of standard physics?such as impossible shadows, colors, reflections or contours?and use these as shortcuts or for effect. Their use often goes completely unnoticed. As artists discover these shortcuts, bending the laws of physics without penalty, they act as research neuroscientists and much can be learned from tracking down their discoveries. The goal is not to expose the \"slip-ups\" of the masters?as entertaining as that might be. Instead it is to understand the reduced set of rules that the brain uses to comprehend the world. THE SPEAKER: Patrick Cavanagh was born in Oakville, Ontario in 1947. He received a degree in Electrical Engineering from McGill University in 1968. An interest in artificial intelligence led to a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from Carnegie-Mellon in 1972. He taught first at the Universit  de Montr al in Psychology and in 1989 he moved to Harvard as professor of Psychology. In 2007 he accepted a Chaire d'Excellence at the Universit  Paris Descartes. His current projects study the roles of visual attention in selecting and creating visual representations, and the properties and strategies of visual attention in normal and brain-damaged subjects. He has also explored how various features such as shadow, color, motion, and texture contribute to representations of visual form. These experiments led to his interest in art as a source of data for neuroscience. ", "title": "How artists bend the laws of physics and get away with it"},

Dr. Sylvester James Gates, Jr. ABSTRACT: Modern cosmology portrays a previously unexpected picture - a universe dominated by dark matter and dark energy. The last two decades have also seen the emergence of Superstring Theory (also known as String/Mtheory), a powerful paradigm for describing fundamental physics on quantum length scales. Are these two conceptual schemes in agreement or conflict? This lecture, utilizing computer graphics, provides an exciting and accessible introduction to this debate at the frontiers of present day scientific research, from the viewpoint of one of the world's most famous string theorists. This lecture is aimed at the layperson or student with an interest in science and physics. THE SPEAKER: He is a professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Maryland. Described as the 'Tiger Woods of Physics', Professor Gates was the first African-American to hold an endowed chair in physics at a major US research university and is famous for his ability to make complex topics accessible. He was educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (B.S. math. 1973, B.S. physics 1973, Ph.D. physics 1977) having written MITs first thesis on \"supersymmetry\", a topic in modern fundamental theoretical physics. Dr. Gates has an impressive portfolio of achievements which include: MIT's 1997 Martin Luther King Jr. Leadership Award, Washington Academy of Science's 1999 College Science Teacher of the Year Award, the American Association of Physics Teacher's 2003 Klopsteg Awards and the National Technical Association's 1993 Physicist of the Year Award. He has appeared on four PBS television scientific documentaries.

Smol ABSTRACT: Striking and often unprecedented ecological changes have occurred in arctic regions over the last 100-150 years. These changes have important implications for all parts of our planet. Potential global warming is predicted to be greatest in high-latitude regions. As a result, attention has been directed towards the use of arctic lakes and ponds as monitoring sites. Fortunately, lakes archive a tremendously important library of information of past changes in their sediments. What do these lakes tell us about our changing environment and about global warming? Is the environment changing? If so, why and by how much? What are the causes of these changes? THE SPEAKER: John P. Smol, B.Sc (McGill), M.Sc.

Already with research into the healthy and diseased brain, novel interventions on the brain are flourishing. These range from advances in neuroimaging research yielding insights into neurological disorders, behaviour and personality to developments in neurosurgical stimulation for motor and neuropsychiatric disorders. Given the importance of the brain in defining who we are and the vulnerability of neurological and psychiatric patients, neuroscience increasingly intersects with crucial ethical, legal, and social issues. We have never perhaps faced so directly the consequences and responsibilities that modern biomedical science bestows upon us as we will with the neuroscience revolution. I will discuss briefly the ethical aspects of basic and clinical neuroscience,  neuroethics  and some of the key challenges in current and future applications of neuroscience. Also, a framework of neuroethical responsibilities including scientific integrity and public engagement will be proposed to tackle challenges in neuroscience. THE SPEAKER: Eric Racine, PhD, is the Director of the Neuroethics Research Unit at the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal (IRCM).

McComas Parks Family Endowed Professorship in Science Education, University of Arkansas ABSTRACT: Darwin s  Mad Dream  as he put it refers to pangenesis, an idea he proposed to describe the rules of inheritance and explain the source of new variation. These conceptions were vital to evolution by natural selection. Beyond historians of biology, few others are familiar with pangenesis because it was ultimately shown to be inaccurate and represents one of Darwin s few errors. The case of pangenesis is not interesting because it was incorrect, but because the account of its development provides an interesting case study into how science works and offers a rare glimpse into Darwin s thinking and personality. Pangenesis can illustrate important  nature of science  ideas such as the need for empirical evidence, the use of inductive reasoning, the creative component of science, the role of bias and subjectivity, social and personal influences on science, and the notion that scientific knowledge is tentative but durable, and ultimately self-correcting. THE SPEAKER: McComas is widely involved in many areas of science education.

For most of the twentieth century, evolutionary theory was restricted to the biological sciences and avoided most human-related subjects. That is now rapidly changing, as virtually every human-related subject is being approached from an evolutionary perspective. As soon as evolution is perceived as unthreatening, explanatory, and useful for understanding the human condition and improving human welfare, it can become not just acceptable but irresistible.

He applies evolutionary theory to all aspects of humanity in addition to the rest of life, both in his own research and as director of EvoS, a unique campus-wide evolutionary studies programme.

Wilson ABSTRACT: How can we become happier, help teenagers navigate the problems of adolescence, reduce racial prejudice, and help college students adjust to university life? Initially these seem like very different problems. I suggest, however, that they are all rooted in the stories people tell themselves to make sense of the world. These stories, or personal narratives, ultimately determine whether people lead healthy, productive lives or have problems. Sometimes, psychotherapy is called for to help people revise their stories. Often people are at a narrative fork in the road. They aren t quite sure what to make of their situation or how to explain it. Social psychologists have discovered a promising approach, called  story-editing,  that nudges people down healthy narrative paths. I will discuss story-editing interventions that have been used in a variety of areas (e.g., to help college students experiencing academic problems, reduce teenage pregnancy, increase personal happiness) and discuss the promise and limitations of these interventions. THE SPEAKER: Timothy D. Wilson is Sherrell J. Aston Professor of Psychology at the University of Virginia. He has published over 100 articles in scholarly journals and edited books, primarily on the topics of self-knowledge, unconscious processing, and personal happiness.

Dr. Molly S. Shoichet University of Toronto ABSTRACT: Regenerative Medicine promises to change the way medicine is delivered.  Instead of treating a symptom, regenerative medicine aims to overcome a disease or disorder. While prosthetics already overcome lost function in some areas, they do not promote healing.  In regenerative medicine the goal is to promote healing without causing further injury.  The promise of regenerative medicine has been realized for skin and cartilage where there are already products on the market.  My laboratory is focused on research in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where regeneration is more complex.  I will describe two strategies to promote repair, one based on endogenous stem cell stimulation and the other based on stem cell transplantation.  These strategies will be described in the context of spinal cord injury, stroke and blindness. THE SPEAKER: Dr. Molly Shoichet is an expert in the study of polymers that promote healing in the body.  She holds the Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Tissue Engineering and is Professor at the University of Toronto.

It s not about agreeing with me,  she says.  I don t care what you think about prostitution. Argue with me!  Ten years after completing her BA in psychology at Concordia, Tremblay returned to pursue a certificate in family education. The program director encouraged her to complete a second BA in applied human sciences instead. During an elective course in sociology, a light went on.  I just thought,  Okay. This is it,  Tremblay recalls.  Sociology was the missing piece! I thought,  How can I understand the individual without understanding the social context?  I needed to know more.  In 2001, Tremblay completed her MA in sociology from Concordia, and a year later landed her first teaching job at the university.  I taught a 200-level course called Social Problems. I was a nervous wreck,  she admits. She need not have worried. An avid reader and social theorist with a strong interest in inequality, deviance and social movements, Tremblay also brought years of experience as a volunteer with indigenous women and sex workers to her teaching practice. Sociology instructor Francine Tremblay says her work experience, including volunteering with indigenous women and sex workers,  keeps my theory grounded.   I like to have one foot in academia and one foot in the real world,  she says.  It keeps my theory grounded.  Recently, Tremblay was appointed chair of External Relations for the Concordia University Part-time Faculty Association (CUPFA). She is also working on a pilot research project aimed at assessing student engagement at Concordia, supported by a $4,000 grant from CUPFA. Community activism, a union role and academic research: it s all part of being an engaged teacher who strives to create the same restless curiosity in her students. Tremblay says she s happy to ruffle a few feathers if it means getting her classes really thinking about the issues affecting their society.  I want to confuse them sometimes,  she says.  As a matter of fact, it s in my course evaluations. Apparently I confuse them. Good! I shape citizens. That s my job.  Patrick McDonagh: a man with many hats A teacher, freelance writer and avid researcher in the field of disability studies, Patrick McDonagh is not sure what he considers his main gig. Patrick McDonagh, a part-time faculty member in the Department of English, is a frequent contributor to Concordia University Magazine.  A lot of effort goes into preparing a course. So it seems that when I m teaching, that s the main thing,  says the part-time faculty member in Concordia s Department of English.  That said, I always have a lot of projects going on the freelance side, and I m also doing a lot of academic research.  In 1998, McDonagh received a PhD in humanities at Concordia for his study of cultural representations of intellectual disability in 19th-century England. A decade later his book, Idiocy: A Cultural History (Liverpool University Press, 2008), was published to critical acclaim.  McDonagh has set a new standard in the history of intellectual disability,  wrote one reviewer from Truman State University. Currently McDonagh is co-editing a collection of essays on the history of ideas of intelligence and intellectual disability, slated for publication next year. The British Columbia native traces his interest in cultural representations of intellectual disability to a summer job he held as a university student working with autistic children.  It ended up being quite fascinating   and some years later I also realized that this interest could become a research project,  he says In 1987, before moving to Montreal to pursue his PhD, McDonagh turned his interest into action, co-founding a non-profit agency in Vancouver that provides support services for people with developmental disabilities, autism and acquired brain injuries. The Spectrum Society for Community Living is still active. While McDonagh is no longer involved in day-to-day operations, he remains on its board of directors. When he first arrived at Concordia as a PhD student, McDonagh immediately sought out work on campus to support himself. With no teaching assistant positions available at that time in his department, he took a job teaching technical writing to engineering students. After earning his PhD, he was offered a part-time position in the Department of English. The job often requires McDonagh to quickly get a handle on weighty texts included in the syllabus for a course he s never taught before. Yet he enjoys the challenge, and the payoff is that he gets the chance to discuss great works of English literature with his students.  I like the preparation, I like digging into it on my own, and the classroom itself is a stimulating environment,  he says.  There are always some good insights that come up   things I wouldn t have thought of, that I find exciting to hear. It s not a bad life, talking about literature with a big group of people.  Robert Mearns: teaching for the fun of it. Part-time faculty member Robert Mearns is celebrating 50 years of teaching mathematics at the high school, CEGEP and university levels.  If I had to do it all over again, I d do exactly the same thing,  he says.  I guess I m one of the lucky ones who s made a career out of something I don t regard as a job. That s why I m still at it.  Mearns earned a BA and MA from Sir George Williams University, one of Concordia s founding institutions, and then an MSc in mathematics from Concordia in 1979. After teaching high school in Chateauguay, Que., in the 1960s, he began working at John Abbott College in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Que., when it first opened in 1971. Four years later he took his first job as a part-time instructor teaching night courses in Concordia s Department of Mathematics and Statistics. Working at Concordia, he says,  was a chance to come down from the milieu where I was, which was kind of homogeneous, and deal with people from all over the world   listen to their stories about why they came here; some of them wanting to go back to their homelands, some not. It was a chance to open up.  Almost 40 years later, Mearns has retired from his full-time role at John Abbott College, but he still teaches 200-level courses mathematics courses at Concordia.  Now I m doing this just for fun,  he says. And how does he describe the particular moment that keeps bringing him back to the classroom? After more than four decades, Robert Mearns is still motivated by the moment his students \"get it.\"  When you see a student sitting in front of you with a stern look on their face, as you re trying to describe something or explain something, and then all of a sudden they crack a smile... You know that they ve got it,  Mearns says.  That s a helluva reward for me. That s what I get out of it.  We ll be running more part-time faculty profiles over the next few weeks. Stay tuned.

If current trends continue, that number will increase to 70 million by 2025, according to the World Heath Organization . It s not just genes that are the cause: socio-demographic and environmental elements are also contributing factors. Lower socio-economic status, living in neighbourhoods that aren t walkable and poor access to fresh fruits and vegetables can all increase the risk of being overweight. With obesity rates on the rise, a team of Montreal-based researchers embarked on a study to find out how parenting styles and the broader social environment combine to affect children's obesity risk.  We thought that certain types of parenting would be associated with a higher risk of childhood obesity, and that the strength of this association would differ between children living in poverty and those who aren t,  says Lisa Kakinami , the study s lead author and an assistant professor in Concordia s Department of Mathematics and Statistics in collaboration with the PERFORM Centre. The study, published in Preventive Medicine, suggests that both poverty and parenting style are important predictors of childhood health.  Successful strategies to combat childhood obesity need to reflect these independent and interactive associations on health,  Kakinami says. She and her research team* used data from a national survey of Canadian youth, carried out by Statistics Canada from 1994 to 2008. They examined information on 37,577 children and compared socio-demographic and socio-economic status, family and neighbourhood characteristics, and height and weight. The researchers also paid particular attention to the types of parenting being reported, and divided those styles into four groups: Authoritative   both responsive and demanding Authoritarian   not responsive but demanding Permissive   responsive but not demanding Negligent   neither responsive nor demanding   Results showed that, for the population as a whole, preschool- and school-age children with authoritarian parents were 35 per cent and 41 per cent more likely to be obese than those with authoritative parents. But household income had an effect for the younger, preschool-age cohort. Among kids living in poverty (i.e., living below the low-income cut-offs established by Statistics Canada), the risk of being obese was 20% greater compared with the risk among kids not living in poverty, and this risk was regardless of parenting style. However, among kids not living in poverty, authoritarian and negligent parenting was associated with 44 per cent and 26 per cent increased likelihood of obesity, respectively. Kakinami speculates that this could be linked to kids  ability to self-regulate their energy intake.  Authoritarian parenting may translate to parents not responding to children's cues of hunger and/or feeling full, and demanding or controlling the child's energy intake,  she says.  That results in the children's ability to regulate their own energy intake being underdeveloped. These children may be more likely to overindulge when given the opportunity.  *Partners in research: This study was supported in part by the Fonds de recherche du Que bec - Sante .

Don Davis: The call of the classroom  Over the last 15 years as a part-time instructor in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science (ENCS), Don Davis, BEng 92, MASc 95, estimates he s taught between 70 and 80 courses in a range of engineering, mathematics and computer-science subjects. This past year alone, he taught nine. Davis, who earned a PhD from McGill University in 2004, is an expert in the field of electromagnetic engineering. He's sometimes hired as a consultant by medical, biomedical or telecommunications companies. While the contracts are lucrative, he says he d rather be in the classroom.  You don t teach for the money; you teach because it s a calling,  Davis says.  As long as it fits with your life, and you feel that you re making a positive impact on other people s lives, you do it. When you stop feeling that, it s time to ask yourself,  Is there something wrong with what I m doing? Has the environment changed?  You have to adapt.  Adapting is the cornerstone of Davis s teaching practice. The veteran instructor, who earned an ENCS Teaching Excellence Award last year, strives to align his curricula with the current demands of industry, and challenges his students to solve the sorts of problems they might encounter in the workplace.  Companies don t hire an engineer because they already have all the answers,  he says.  An engineer is something who s in the tool shed of a lot of companies, and they re called on when there s a problem.  With the goal of creating a dynamic, interactive learning environment, Davis always includes ample time for questions and discussion in his classes.  The really skilled students have already read the book; they already know what I have to say,  he says.  What they re in class for is to fill in the gaps. It s really during the interaction that the learning occurs.  For Davis, the ideal classroom is one in which the learning flows both ways.  It s not my great knowledge being shared with the world so much as it is my understanding blending with their understanding,  he says.  Sometimes the students  questions, or my answers, are actually developing a new type of understanding. That s the whole point of this.    Christine Que:  I enjoy the interaction I have with my students.  | Photo by Concordia University Christine Que: An unexpected career path   Growing up, I always said that teaching was a job I d never do,  says Christine Que, a part-time faculty member in the Centre for Engineering in Society.  I didn t like having the attention on me. Speaking in front of people was a kind of torture.  Thanks to Que s passion for languages, though, that changed. After a few years of working as an accountant, she left her hometown of Vancouver for Quebec City, where she studied French at Universit  Laval.  I needed a part-time job, and my French wasn t good enough to get any other kind of job,  she says.  The one I did manage to get was teaching French at a private language school.  Her first class was daunting, but Que quickly got over her shyness and developed a love of teaching languages.  I enjoy the interaction I have with my students, particularly in the smaller classes, where I get to know each of them,  she says.  It helps to motivate them when they know that they re not just a face in the crowd.  Que later came to Concordia to pursue a certificate in T eaching English as Second Language . She followed that up with a master s in applied linguistics. As a graduate student, she taught two English as a Second Language courses for the Department of Education. After graduating, Que was offered a part-time job teaching Technical Writing and Research Methods for Engineers and Computer Scientists, a required class for master s students in those disciplines who need to improve their English-language proficiency before graduating. The course was a major challenge for Que.  There I was, facing 30 students, and I had no engineering background. It was a high learning curve!  She soon adapted, though, and now teaches the course regularly.  I like the class because the students really seem to appreciate what you re doing for them,  she says.  They re a nice bunch who are curious to learn.  With her limited seniority, Que can only teach two courses a year at Concordia for now, but she also picks up language classes at McGill University and Coll ge de Maisonneuve.  I have a pretty busy schedule between the three places, and I m never bored,  Que says.  There s so much to learn.    Pierre Gauthier:  I want to be here as long as I can keep contributing.  | Photo courtesy Pierre Gauthier Pierre Gauthier: A focus on real-world knowledge  Next year will mark Pierre Gauthier s 30th as a part-time instructor at Concordia. He hopes he ll be at the university for 30 more.  I often joke that they re going to have to kick me out of here,  he says. Gauthier, PhD 96, began teaching at Concordia at 22, as a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.  I ve been teaching like a madman ever since,  he says. But that s not all he s been doing. For the last 25 years, Gauthier has also held down a full-time engineering job. He now works for Rolls-Royce Canada Ltd. As team lead for the company s combustion numerical methods group, Gauthier is in charge of the mathematical models that analyze the combustion systems of jet engines used as stationary power plants.  I m very lucky because I ve got a foot in both worlds, and the two worlds communicate with each other,  he says.  Everything I do at work, I get to teach it here at Concordia.  Straddling the professional and academic spheres allows Gauthier to point to the real-life applications of what he s teaching. That s a touch his students appreciate.  The age-old question is,  When will I ever use this?  Well, I can tell them,  I used it this morning.  Then they pay attention,  he says.  I even bring in parts of engines, sometimes, and say,  The stuff we re doing today may seem abstract, but we actually use it to figure out something specific inside the engine.  Teaching also allows Gauthier to sharpen his own engineering and mathematical knowledge base.  It s like going to the gym every day, in terms of keeping me on top of what I do at work,  he says. Gauthier recently became an affiliate associate professor, allowing him to supervise graduate students and run his own research projects with them   something he had already been doing at work.  I m a proud Concordia graduate, so I try and bring as many Concordia students as I can into Rolls-Royce to do internships and summer work terms,  he says. Although most of Gauthier s courses draw on his mathematics and engineering expertise, he also teaches a course at the School of Extended Learning that provides struggling students with practical tools for success.  When I teach this course, I feel I m really making a difference because I can see a change in them from the beginning to the end of the term.  After almost 30 years, Gauthier is committed as ever to his part-time job at Concordia.  I want to be here as long as I can keep contributing,  he says.  I have a lot of fun doing it.

Wrong. As millions of students head back to school next week, more than half will use exactly that kind of thinking when faced with fractions for the first time. New research from Concordia University shows that for children to understand math, teachers must constantly make the connection between abstract numbers and tangible examples. Helena Osana, associate professor in the Department of Education, and PhD candidate Nicole Pitsolantis put this theory to the test in a classroom of fifth and sixth graders. Their findings   published in the highly regarded journal Teaching Children Mathematics, as well as the British Journal of Educational Psychology   show students understand math much more clearly when teachers use pictures and concrete models to demonstrate what fractions actually mean. Those connections are even stronger when the model is personally meaningful to the students. Write out   on the blackboard and the concept is not so clear. Show kids   of a shoelace or talk about running   of the way to school and suddenly they get it. Although many teachers already use models when talking about fractions   for instance, a picture of a pie with slices eaten   they often put them away too quickly. To prove that the continuous use of models made a bigger impact, Osana and Pitsolantis tried teaching with models for only part of the lesson, and then for the entire lesson. They found that students showed much greater understanding when the models were present.  Our study shows teachers should not only include pictures and models while teaching fractions, but also have them side by side throughout the class while continually making clear connections between the concepts and the models,  says Osana. The lessons learned from this research project have the potential to go beyond the classroom.  This is something not only useful for teachers but also for parents,  says Osana.  Because children are studying fractions, parents think they re not able to help. But they can have positive effect on learning too. Something as simple as writing   out on a piece of paper, then demonstrating what it means to use   of a cup of sugar, or filling up the gas tank until it reaches the mark, then writing and pointing to the numbers  ,  can really go a long way towards demystifying math.  Pitsolantis, who also teaches fourth- and fifth-grade math at Lower Canada College in Montreal, says that the depth of misunderstanding that happens when models are abandoned surprised her. She and Osana are now running tests to determine how teachers can successfully incorporate concrete models into the curriculum for other grades. This research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. Related Links ", "title": "Children grasp math more easily with real-world examples"},

Concordia is one of only eight Canadian universities to achieve CAE status, a designation that is awarded for five years. To qualify for this coveted certification, the university s actuarial programs had to meet eight criteria including curriculum, graduate count and quality, and connection to industry. Jos  Garrido, professor of mathematics and statistics and graduate program director. | Photo: Concordia University  We ve been offering undergraduate actuarial programs for 30 years now, so this is a recognition of the quality of the students we graduate, the graduate education we provide, and the research that is carried out here,  says Jos  Garrido, professor of mathematics and statistics and graduate program director. Schools designated as CAEs are eligible to apply for substantial multi year education and research grants offered by the SOA, adds Garrido.  Every year, it s harder to get funding because of budget and government cutbacks, and there are very few scholarships available for graduate students, especially if they re international. So this is very good news, both to support our graduate students   who can apply for extra scholarships they weren t eligible for before   and to receive research money for faculty members who want to pursue special projects. It s exciting to have these new sources of funding.  Ewa Duma, the actuarial mathematics program director, coordinated the CAE application with the SOA. Concordia had applied for CAE status when the program was launched during the 2008-09 school year, but did not meet the faculty size requirement.  We hired a new person last summer, so now we re four professors actively teaching and researching in the program, and that really made all the difference,  says Garrido.  It s thanks to the commitment of the Faculty of Arts and Science that we ve been able to grow in a way that we now satisfy all these criteria.  Accredited programs are more attractive to prospective students, especially those pursuing graduate studies, because of the additional funding sources, he added.  The SOA has made a tremendous effort to communicate this news about our designation; they sent a press release to all their members worldwide. They are the largest actuarial professional organization in the world. This will also have an impact when we recruit new faculty members.  Concordia offers several other programs that have been accredited nationally or internationally:   All engineering programs offered by the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.   The John Molson School of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Its Bachelor of Commerce (Major in Accountancy) Program is accredited by the Certified Management Accountants of Canada National Board of Directors.   The Specialization in the Exercise Science/Athletic Therapy program is one of six athletic therapy programs accredited by the Canadian Athletic Therapists Association in Canada and it is the only accredited program in Quebec and Eastern Canada.   The Department of Psychology s clinical training program is accredited by both the Canadian and American psychological associations and by the Ordre des psychologues du Qu bec.   The MA in Creative Arts Therapies, Art Therapy Option, is accredited by the Canadian Art Therapy Association and the American Art Therapy Association.

Instead, the assistant professor in the Department of English opted to work these social media tools into her teaching. \"I figured, they want to write? I'll let them write in the way they want on the sites where they want to write,\" says Novakovich. \"The impulse to write using these new tools comes from the students so the practice engages them in a way few lectures could.\" Novakovich will be one of a handful of Concordia professors participating in a panel discussion and showcase on how to incorporate social media into course design at the upcoming conference titled e.SCAPE: Knowledge, Teaching, Technology, on April 3, 4 and 5 on the Sir George Williams Campus. Fred Szabo | Photo by Concordia University Fred Szabo is among the dozens of Concordia professors sharing his experiences at the conference. The professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics has more than 20 years experience with online teaching and learning.  Technology makes routine computations a breeze,\" says Szabo. \"But online learning also allows my students to turn to the lecture material when they want, as often as they want.\"  Szabo sees other benefits to online learning, believing it enables greater collaboration between students and frees up class time for greater face-to-face discussion and exploration of material. At e.SCAPE, he ll deliver two presentations. One is a workshop on how to add interactivity to online courses; the other shows how to use Moodle to manage and improve teaching and learning experiences. Course design will be the focus of another workshop at e.SCAPE featuring two Concordians. Joanne Locke, associate-dean, academic programs in the Faculty of Arts and Science, and Anne Wade, manager and information specialist in the Centre for the Study of Learning and Performance, created an online version of Introduction to Library Research Practices, a course that develops information-literacy skills. The original course, first developed more than 20 years ago, has evolved to teach fundamental research skills to undergraduates throughout the university. A year ago, Locke and Wade collaboratively developed the online version of the course.      Taking the course online opened up information literacy to students looking for greater flexibility in their schedules,  says Wade.  Now, the course content can be delivered in a consistent fashion to students wherever they may be.  Anne Wade | Photo by Concordia University. Locke also points out, \"Students today are increasingly dependent on web-based resources and online search engines for their research. This shift to teaching online allows students a greater opportunity to sift through these resources, evaluate them, and participate more actively in demonstrations of search applications.\" Some professors worry that keeping up with emerging technologies poses a considerable challenge. Yet, it's a challenge many have answered through creativity and innovation. Professors who have integrated technology into their teaching also note that, although not every course can be taught effectively online and not every student learns best that way, they see the merits in these advances to teaching and learning. Many students do, too. In the past two years, registration in online courses at Concordia has risen steadily to 11,973 students during fall 2012, compared with 10,921 a year before, and 13,042 this winter, compared with 11,945 in the 2012 winter term. In surveys regarding their satisfaction with the course material, the way it was delivered and the opportunity for interaction with faculty and teaching assistants, 75 per cent of students indicated they are satisfied or very satisfied.  Research is being done by Concordia faculty to identify the conditions most favourable to enhancing educational experience through integrating technology. Novakovich, for example, has gone beyond using Twitter and Facebook as writing tools to study the impact multimedia narrative strategies and blogging have had on students  writing skills. Her research showing blogging s positive impact on the quality of their writing was recently accepted for publication in the Journal of Educational Technology and Society. Novakovich is currently pursuing a PhD at Concordia in education with a specialization in Educational Technology.  The e.SCAPE conference is designed to support Concordia's Academic Plan. The plan's three main priorities for the 2012-13 academic year are innovative and dynamic undergraduate offerings, graduate student recruitment, and investments in the libraries. e.SCAPE is scheduled Wednesday, April 3, through Friday, April 5, from 9 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. Keynote addresses are scheduled daily at noon. The conference is open to the entire Concordia community: students, staff and faculty. No advance registration is required; admission to sessions is on a first-come, first-served basis.

He s also enrolled in the Actuarial Mathematics/Finance Program, jointly offered by the Faculty of Arts and Science and the John Molson School of Business, which is quite selective: only about 15 students are accepted each year.  Steven has a cumulative GPA of 4.11 and he has already passed two professional exams of the Society of Actuaries,  says Yogendra P. Chaubey, chair of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. Those achievements earned him the Morneau Shepell scholarship award, which was established for second-year actuarial math undergraduates who maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0.

He just works hard.  It comes down to time management, but you have to be balanced,  says the third-year actuarial mathematics and finance student in Concordia's Department of Mathematics and Statistics and a member of the Institute for Co-operative Education .  Get involved. Volunteer. There s no secret, you just have to put the work in.  On November 7, Azzoparde was awarded the Bourse Gilles Joncas, given to the top co-op student in Quebec by the Association canadienne de l enseignement cooperative (ACDEC), Quebec branch. The honour recognizes a student s academic achievements, performance during work terms, participation in extra-curricular activities and volunteer contributions. Azzoparde s work-term supervisors have nominated him twice for the Co-op Employer s Choice award, and he was one of only 46 actuarial students in the world selected to attend the Society of Actuaries  (SOA) international student conference in Chicago this past August. By the time Azzoparde officially graduates in spring 2016, he ll have completed three internships in three different departments   retirement consulting, health and group benefits consulting, and investment consulting   at the Montreal branch of Towers Watson, an American global professional services firm.  Jason impressed us with his high level of maturity, his motivation, his technical capabilities and his ability to learn quickly,  says Marie-Pier Otis, Azzoparde s supervisor from Towers Watson during his work term last winter. Gerry Hughes, director of the Institute of Co-operative Education at Concordia, says Azzoparde was a highly recommended candidate for this bursary, along with two other Concordia Co-op students:  He has an incredible balance in that he wants to succeed, he has the drive to succeed, and he always treats people in a respectful manner.  Azzoparde says the fast-paced, stimulating working environment has allowed him to learn a lot in a short time, setting him up well for when he finishes school.  Each team offers something different, which is good for any student hungry to learn. It allows me to see many different aspects of the actuarial industry, so I can decide what track to take upon graduation.  Finding balance Although he has just added a major provincial prize to his resum , Azzoparde says the accomplishment he s most proud of so far is passing five professional, actuarial exams while balancing his busy schedule, maintaining a high GPA, and earning strong reviews from his work-term supervisors.  Sports gave me a balance to the stress of performing academically,  says Azzoparde. | Photo by Tiffany Azzoparde Every morning during his work terms, Azzoparde would arrive at the office early to study. The hard work has paid off and he s already managed to pass more actuarial exams than most students he spoke to at the SOA conference last summer. Ranked in the top 15 per cent of his academic program, Azzoparde is also a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society and played two seasons with the Concordia Stingers football team. It s unusual for a Co-op student to become a member of a varsity team at Concordia, due to the time commitments required. But Azzoparde s exceptional work ethic earned him a spot on the squad.  Sports gave me a balance to the stress of performing academically,  he says.  It was a passion for me. My mind was off my studies and it helped in the long run.  After two seasons, Azzoparde was forced to leave the team this year to participate in a work term. In spite of everything he s achieved so far, Azzoparde remains modest, saying he didn t expect to be selected for the Gilles Joncas Bursary.  It was an unbelievable feeling. I don t go through life expecting things. I treat every achievement like it s my first, and I don t take anything for granted.  One thing Azzoparde shouldn t have to worry about when he graduates from Concordia is finding a job. However, he does want to make sure that whatever he ends up doing is meaningful.  I really want to make a difference in whichever role I assume in life,  he says. With his resum , the sky s the limit.

I m so grateful to Concordia for hosting and nurturing kids with an interest in math,  says Vadim Tsypin, a retired software developer with a math degree and a gifted daughter. Allison Tsypin is participating in the Montreal Math Circle . She spends Sunday mornings exploring logic problems, Dirichlet's principle and geometry, among other things. Hosted by Concordia, in a joint project with l' Institut des sciences math matiques (ISM) , the Montreal Math Circle is a self-funded, independent enrichment program for young students   grades three to eight   interested in solving math problems at their school level. After two successful pilot sessions last fall, a third held in January and the fourth will start on February 21 and run until March 13.  Math Circle breaks out of the traditional teacher-student model, with more informal collaboration and brainstorming,  Tsypin says. How it works Facilitated by Alina Stancu , associate professor in Concordia s Department of Mathematics and Statistics and ISM director, and run by PhD candidate Ildiko Pelczer, Math Circle divides students into three groups according to age and grade. On average, there are 10 kids per age group   half are girls, in the younger sections. They work individually and collectively on the same problems during the 90-minute, Sunday morning sessions led by Pelczer.  There s a need for this kind of thing in Montreal,  says Pelczer, who started doing four-hour mathematical Olympiads in Romania in grade seven.  It shows that math is creative and the students have the freedom to be inventive. And we work on the kind of contest questions that you don t usually see in school.  Four-prong outreach Montreal Math Circle is just one of four math outreach initiatives by Concordia. Another is the Canadian Math Kangaroo Contest , a 20-year-old worldwide math competition that debuted in Canada in 2001. Anna Sierpinska , a Concordia professor who specializes in math education, initiated hosting the contest at Concordia in 2012. Since then, she has remained involved, and the contest s hosting is organized by Pelczer and department administrator Jane Venettacci. The registration deadline for the next Kangaroo contest is March 7, for the March 20 event. Over 200 students are expected.  Engaging the Montreal community in mathematics and statistics is important to us, whether hosting or participating in mathematical competitions for elementary to high-school children, or sponsoring mathematical competitions and student-related activities,  says Nadia Hardy , associate professor of mathematics and chair of the department.  We are dedicated to continuing our involvement, and finding new ways of increasing our outreach.  Tournament of Towns Concordia s third and newest outreach initiative is the international mathematics competition called Tournament of Towns . It s a problem-solving contest for students up to the age of 18 that began in Russia in the late 1970s.  More than 120 cities participate, from more than 25 countries,  says Stancu.  The main goal of this tournament is to provide an opportunity for a large number of students to participate in a competition with worldwide standards. Some problems can be very challenging, yet they require creative use of simple tools rather than advanced mathematical knowledge.  The next tournament is scheduled for February 28. It will be held on the Sir George Williams Campus. To register, email each student s name and school grade to montrealmathclub@gmail.com by February 23. Formula of Unity The fourth outreach initiative is the International Mathematical Olympiad Formula of Unity/The Third Millennium for students from grades six to 12. Organized by the Saint Petersburg State University and the Euler Foundation, it was first held in the 2013-14 academic year. During the 2014-15 edition, it gathered more than 6,000 students from 15 countries. In Montreal, the tournament is facilitated by Concordia s Department of Mathematics and Statistics and  l'Institut des sciences math matiques (ISM).  It takes place in two rounds. The second round   which invites students who received the best results in the first round   will be held on February 21.  Exponential growth?  Right now, we are creating a vibrant math community, which is very important to all, and we hope to add to our activities a one or two-week summer camp,  says Stancu.  The challenge will be getting the right logistics support with things like payroll, legal issues, general administration. The enthusiasm from the kids is already there.  To register your child for the next Montreal Math Circle session, which runs from February 21 until March 13, email  montrealmathclub@gmail.com , indicating your name, and the name and school grade of your child. The next Canadian Math Kangaroo Contest takes place on March 20. Register your child by March 7. The next Tournament of Towns contest is February 28.

It is with profound sadness that we report the death of our colleague Professor Syed Twareque Ali on the 24th of January 2016 whilst on an academic visit to Malaysia. He is survived by his wife Fauzia Begum, their son Syed Furrokh-Nabeel Ali (Samira Karim), and grandson Syed Aydin Karim Ali. Twareque completed his doctoral studies in mathematical physics at the University of Rochester in1973.  After periods of research and teaching in ICTP Trieste, University of Toronto, UPEI, and ITP Clausthal, Germany, he joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Concordia University in 1981.  He was promoted to full professor here in 1990. Twareque pursued research in many areas of mathematics, mostly in analysis, functional analysis, and quantum mechanics.  He published his work with numerous scientists around the world in over 120 research articles and in a number of books. He was always studying and preparing lectures, now wavelets, now differential geometry, now group theory. His presentations were structured, lucid, interesting, deep, and, before the fashion of electronic displays, by means of perfectly clear handwriting on the blackboard.  He was not inclined to profess an overt teaching philosophy but an observer might infer that it was  empowerment through mathematical understanding .  He was himself impressively erudite with an eclectic taste that included history, philosophy and literature, and the mastery of at least five European languages in addition to Bengali and Hindi, and some Farsi and Arabic. He was extremely generous and engendered enormous affection in his students and colleagues. He had an amusing story or anecdote for almost every occasion   often related to other mathematicians he knew from his extensive travels   and had a repertoire of funny jokes that naturally prompted his distinctive laughter. His inspiring presence and cheerful demeanor will be sorely missed by us all. Testimonials can be sent  here  for publication. March 17, 2016 With deep sorrow, I learned about the passing of Dr. Ali. Twareque was a very well known scientist, with important contributions in the field of Mathematics and Physics, but even more important he was an exceptional human being. I first met him in Havana, Cuba in the nineties. Had the honour to organize, jointly with him, the first workshop in Wavelets and Quantization Methods at the University of Havana. Thanks to his remarkable persistence, the event went on for almost two decades and left a fingerprint in the scientific community, not only in Cuba but in a wider Latin American context.  His leadership allowed for a durable and fruitful relationship between both Math departments at Concordia and Havana universities , along all these years. He fell in love with the city of Havana and its people, and was consequent with this feeling over his entire life. There, he left behind numerous friends and colleagues, well aware of his limitless generosity, sense of solidarity and contagious laugh. Pablo Olivares Associate Professor, Department of Mathematics Ryerson University February 18, 2016 There is nothing not to like about Professor Ali. I first met him in Malaysia, during his first visit as an invited speaker to our Expository Quantum Lecture Series in 2007 (EQuaLS1) with the theme of Geometry, Number Theory and Quantum Physics 2007. He for sure was among the expert in the field of quantization theory. The event was organized by INSPEM, University Putra Malaysia. During his visit, I approached him discussing whether I can further my Ph.D under his supervision. He agreed and through his help and justification mentioning Montreal is among the best place to study mathematical physics, I managed to get a government scholarship starting early September 2008. Days in Montreal have never been so difficult for us. Despite being an expert in his field, he was so humble in nature. He has been very helpful with almost everything since the early day we arrived. His friends are all over and through him, my other half has had this opportunity to make contacts with the engineering department of Concordia and until now remain in good relationship. Our almost five years in Montreal have been so fruitful. Thanks to him. After I finished in 2014, we remained to be in good contacts and he has supported our EQuaLS series continuously. Therefore, his recent visit to Malaysia (EQuaLS8) was the most unforgettable memory since it didn't occur to me that it was going to be his last visit. He has contributed much to our institute, INSPEM through his ideas, suggestions and a lot more. Most of us here in Malaysia will never forget Prof. Ali and he has become part of our big 'family' here in the institute. Professor Ali will definitely be missed. My deepest condolences, to his wife and family. Nurisya Mohd Shah Senior Lecturer, Department of Physics University Putra Malaysia February 8, 2016 I was postdoctoral fellow at CRM on October 1999.  I think it must have been early November, and an elegant sir apparently of Indian origin (I did not know at the time he was from Bangladesh) knocked at the ajar door of my office and introduced himself to me in Italian, with the typical regional accent of Trieste. That was a surreal moment! Over the past 16 years he has been a continuous presence in personal and professional life; his then PhD student Anna, became my wife and Twareque was present at my wedding in Poland (and he danced too!) His office is just two doors down the corridor: his endearing laughter still echoes in my ear when I sit in my office. His wide interests and education made his company fantastically pleasant and never obtrusive. I have very fond memories of Twareque, in particular those associated to the conferences we attended together, several times, in Bialowieza and Havana. His untimely passing leaves all of us disconcerted. My wife Anna, my Parents Daria and Pino and myself are deeply saddened by his passing and wish to extend our most heartfelt condolences to his wife Fauzia and son Nabeel and his family.  Marco Bertola Professor, Dept. of Math & Stats Concordia University February 3, 2016 I knew Twareque since he began his career at Concordia.  He was special and unique in so many ways.  Academically, he was very well established as an expert in mathematical physics and had professional contacts literally in every corner of the world.  I don t know anyone else who traveled as extensively as he did to give invited talks, or to participate in conferences, or official exchange programs between Concordia and other universities that were created through his initiative, such as the annual one between Concordia and the University of Havana and another one with the University of Bialystok, Poland. Twareque was one of the most broadly educated people I have known.  Besides his own areas of expertise in mathematical physics, he was familiar with philosophy, history, literature and poetry. He spoke six or seven languages, and was quite at home in most of the countries he visited.  He was an excellent teacher who also taught in the Science College from time to time and the students there greatly appreciated the way he introduced them to genuine mathematical thinking.  He had a terrific sense of humour and an endless supply of stories and anecdotes.  I chatted with him over a cup of coffee just a few days before he left for Malaysia and feel a very profound sense of loss.  We will all miss his stories, his laughter, his wisdom and his expertise. Hal Proppe Professor, Dept. of Math & Stats Concordia University February 2, 2016 Twareque is one of the most outstanding men I have known. A man of great culture and modesty. I am friends with Twareque since 1998. I had the chance to meet him thanks to one of the many academic responsibilities he had, both within and outside the university, such as member of the Graduate Committee of the Mathematics and Statistics Department at Concordia University, 1999-2002; member of a special committee appointed by the Dean to study the future of the Department of Physics and that recommended measures to restructure it, 2000-2001; he was a member of the Organizing Committee of the XI to the XXVI Colloquia on Geometric Methods in Physics, developed in Bialowieza, Poland, from 1992 to 2007; Director of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences of Montreal, 2003-2006; member of the Organizing Committee and founder of I to XVIII Workshops held in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Havana; he helped the development of international scientific cooperation between the University of Havana, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and the Center for International Academic Cooperation at Concordia University. In particular, Twareque's contribution to the scientific development of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer at University of Havana was outstanding, since 1998 when he began collaborating with the Faculty, encouraging the participation of its members in research and in the development of the research on Wavelets and its various applications, including in Physics. Another of Twareque's contributions was the organization of an annual workshop of international importance to promote the participation of - and exchange with - young faculty members, which gave much added vitality to the event. Twareque showed a great capacity to help the University of Havana and in particular, the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, by donations of computer equipment for the Faculty and through his efforts in bringing international experts to exchange experiences with the Cuban mathematical community and to deliver specialized courses. In 2009, in recognition for his service and efforts, the University of Havana awarded Twareque the special title of Invited Professor. He was a man of extreme human sensitivity. Special friend of my family. We regret the loss of a great friend and a great man of science. I wish to express my condolences to his wife Fauzia and son Nabeel.

On December 10, Concordia recognized 253 employees who have reached milestones in their careers at the university with the annual Long Service and Retiree Luncheon. The numbers say it all. There were 21 people with 20 years of service, 46 with 25 years, 19 with 30 years, 27 with 35 years, 11 with 40 years, nine with 45 years, three with a remarkable 50 years, as well as 117 retirees. Benoit-Antoine Bacon , Concordia s provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs, congratulated staff and faculty for their dedicated service. He joked about trying to  wrap his head around  the fact that some of those being honoured had worked at Concordia when the Beatles were new on the pop music scene.  Thank you to everyone who has built Concordia into the amazing place that it is today,  said Bacon.  Everyone s unique contribution over the years has given us our character today.  June S. Chaikelson, 50 years at Concordia. | All photos by Concordia University Alan Shepard , the university s president, noted that  Manfred \"Fred\" Szabo  was celebrating his 51st year of service as a professor in the  Department of Mathematics and Statistics , while  June S. Chaikelson , a professor in the  Department of Psychology , and  Barry Frank , a professor in the  Department of Physics , were just one year behind, at 50 years of service.  After so many years the sense of bond we have with each other is strong,  said Shepard, before outlining Concordia s  strategic directions .  Maybe we met a mate here, sent our children to university here, and made deep connections. Concordia is ultimately about people, not buildings   As retirees, you re still ambassadors, so please continue to spread the word about Concordia and the new strategic directions that make us a next-generation university.  Representing the honourees, Eric Goldner, a manager of  Student Recruitment , took the microphone to discuss his experience growing up with a father who worked as a counsellor at Concordia. Goldner Jr. went on to contribute his own 25 years of service, and counting.  Now, as a student recruiter, when I tell prospective students and their parents about our long-term service, it resonates well,  said Goldner, who has held seven jobs in seven different departments across campus.  Each of us plays a part, and it wouldn t be the same without your contribution and commitment to the evolution of Concordia.  Peter Shizgal, 40 years at Concordia. \"It's gratifying to see how the institution has advanced and developed.\" Cheryl Williams, a retired department assistant from the  Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema , was among the honourees. Over the years, she has enjoyed following the careers of graduates, including feature film director Christian Duguay and animator Chris Hinton.  Sometimes, it felt like I had 300 kids,  laughed Williams, who served for 30 years.  The animators and film studies students are quiet, while the film production students are more outgoing. I ll miss them all.  Another honouree, Peter Shizgal , a professor of psychology, is celebrating 40 years of service. Like Williams, he enjoys the collegial nature of his department.  The department was on the rise when I started, and my area   behavioural neurobiology   really took off,  he said.  It s gratifying to see how the institution has advanced and developed.  Shizgal has no plans to retire. He will continue to focus his research on reward and decision making.  I have a grant that doesn t run out until 2018, and I ve applied to renew a grant that I ve had since 1976. It would provide funding until 2021.  Venkat Ramachandran, 45 years at Concordia. \"I'm proud to have been a part of that.\" Venkat Ramachandran , a professor from the  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , is celebrating 45 years at Concordia. His son followed his footsteps, studying electrical engineering at Concordia, and now teaches at Rowan University in New Jersey.  The department expanded and made a name for itself,  said Ramachandran, who has 21 academic awards in research, teaching, administration and engineering education.

Luckily, with the help of Mitacs   a national not-for-profit organization that designs and delivers research and training programs for Canadian academics   Concordia students are being given the chance to do just this. Putting theories to work Take Sandra Maria Nawar, a master s candidate who specializes in actuarial science.  At the end of the first year of my program I began doing my research and I really wanted to apply my theories in an exciting business setting,  she explains.  My graduate supervisor told me about the Mitacs program and things came together quickly after that.  Nawar met with Mitacs representative Jean-Philippe Valois to go over her interests. A match was soon made with Aviva Canada, an insurance company that had worked with Mitacs and Concordia students in the past. At Aviva, Nawar is using her research to help the company improve its decision making for insurance rates so it can manage costly claims   a process known as risk modelling.  The idea is to give Aviva a competitive advantage in this area by improving their overall accuracy in predicting claim severities and frequencies.  Her supervisor at Aviva, Charles Dugas   who also happens to be a former Mitacs participant   sees Nawar as vital to improving important processes the company depends upon to stay competitive.  It s a fast-paced business and we don t always have the time to develop and test new ideas,  he says.  Having a bright, hardworking student examining how we do our business is invaluable. Sandra is also a vital link for us when it comes to the newest trends in research and development that are being discussed in academia, something that can get lost in the daily grind of the business world.  For students at all stages of research Nawar s graduate supervisor, Jose Garrido , a professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics , is a huge proponent of the Mitacs program. To date, he has referred four students he has supervised.  For students who are in the early process of their research, a Mitacs internship can give them ideas as to how to further develop their work,  says Garrido.  For those in the later stages, it s a chance to take their idea and run with it in a way that can benefit a company.  When it comes to Nawar, Garrido believes her success at Aviva is a direct result of her drive and personality.  Sandra is the type of student who can t only live in theory, she needed to get her hands dirty and put her research to work. This kind of outlet and experience will give her a great advantage once she graduates.  If you are a student or a supervisor interested in the variety of programs offered by Mitacs, contact Jean-Philippe Valois, director of Business Development, at jpvalois@mitacs.ca or 514-575-0425.

Student Jason Azzoparde tells us On February 5, Concordia's national finalist shadowed the president of PSP Investments Posted on February 5, 2016 | By: Jason Azzoparde Undergraduate Jason Azzoparde, a student in Concordia's  Department of Mathematics and Statistics  and a member of the  Institute for Co-operative Education , was recently selected as one of 18 finalists in the annual CEO for a Day competition , run by executive search firm Odgers Berndtson.  The fourth-year student in actuarial mathematics and finance  spent yesterday, February 5, shadowing Andr  Bourbonnais, president and CEO of PSP Investments . It was an opportunity to network with top level executives and learn about their roles in the company. Here's Azzoparde's story about his day at the top of the corporate ladder.  Morning meeting at PSP The day began with a breakfast in Andr  Bourbonnais's office. Daniel Garant, executive vice-president and chief investment officer (CIO), was also in attendance. This was an opportunity to introduce ourselves and speak about our interests in the financial markets. Andr  and Daniel advised me on their current market outlook and where they see opportunities to tailor their global portfolio.   Human resources and talent management takeaways The next stop was Guy Archambault's office, senior vice-president of Human Resources and Talent Management. Guy explained how he built the human resources structure from when the company was at about 10 per cent of its current size. He also informed me about current headwinds he is facing in the fast-growing company. Sonia Goyette, senior director of Talent Management also gave me a glimpse of her recruiting strategies for both experienced professionals and new graduates. The CEO even challenged me on a real human capital management case regarding relocation compensation. A CEO must constantly weigh the opportunities of reducing compensation costs while still minimizing the talent turnover rate.    Tense moments on the trading floor This was by far the most exciting part of the day! I was given a quick summary of the public market trading activities, both on the equity and derivatives side. The trading operations of the institution are fast-paced and these analysts must perform market transactions in a very limited time frame. I even had the privilege of witnessing a real-life arbitrage strategy as the trader walked me through the transaction. I must admit that my heart rate was racing as we were approaching the execution of the deal! More insights over lunch Lunch was scheduled at Decca 77 with Anik Lanthier, senior vice-president of Public Equities and Absolute Return, Stephane Jalbert, managing director in Real Estate Investments, and Guthrie Stewart, senior vice-president and global head of Private Investments. I had the opportunity to learn more about their successful careers and certain challenges they faced along the way. $100-million deals and a leader with impressive poise  The afternoon began with an investment pitch from Hong Kong investors. I was able to meet the chairman and CEO of the fund and attentively analyze the deal proposal. These meetings are key to the success of PSP in developing a well-diversified portfolio. Not to mention, many deals are executed for way over $100 million! Mr. Bourbonnais has a long-lasting relationship with many of his overseas business partners and observing him in action was impressive, to say the least. Finally, a presentation was conducted at the PSP office by a top Canadian bank. The CEO and other senior executive members were present to exchange business ideas. It was an intimidating, yet humbling feeling to be sitting alongside two distinguished Canadian CEOs. Looking back on my day, I can truly say that a CEO s life has multiple dimensions to it. The culture a leader brings to a corporation is key to growth and sustainability. Andr  is a well-rounded individual, one that cares for his people while demanding nothing short of excellence. A true leader by heart, Andr  has demonstrated that the right mix of passion, vision and intelligence can go a long way toward building a successful career.

Today, Concordia is recognizing 250 employees who have reached milestones in their careers at the university with the annual Long Service and Retiree Luncheon . Leading up to the event, we are profiling some of this year s honourees to both celebrate their important achievements and acknowledge their service, loyalty and dedication to the community. Alfonsina (Alfie) Plenzich: devoted administrator Payroll Administrator, Human Resources 40 years at Concordia Alfie Plenzich remembers her first day at Concordia: September 15, 1975. She was 19 years old.  My colleagues were approaching me to give me work and I wondered why they were not addressing me by my name, Alfonsina,  recounts Plenzich.  I soon figured out that, like in my childhood, they were having a hard time pronouncing my name. So I said,  By the way, you can call me Alfie.  Alfie Plenzich Plenzich   who still goes by Alfie   says their reaction was one of relief. She says her years at Concordia have been full of funny stories, friendships and learning.  You know when you're a child and you re growing up, and your mother and father teach you? Well, Concordia became that to me,  says Plenzich.  I was a child from an immigrant family. In my area, I was surrounded by Italian people. When I came here it was all kinds of people. The best part was the knowledge, the surroundings and my co-workers, some of whom are now part of my life.  One of those people is her husband, Alan Gingell, who works in the Mail Services division of Facilities Management. They met in 1992 at a university event. During her four decades at Concordia, Plenzich has worked for Financial Services , which handled payroll before it came under the umbrella of Human Resources , as well as for the Faculty of Arts and Science as a budget officer.  Today, she is a payroll administrator with Human Resources. For the calendar year Plenzich works on income taxes, and for the fiscal year, balance-sheet accounts. She also serves as a resource person for her colleagues and the university community. Over the years, Plenzich has experienced first-hand the integration of new technologies and watched the university transform.  Everything we did was by hand. Then one day they decided they were going to put this foreign thing on my desk called a computer,  says Plenzich with a laugh.  Now I cannot live without a computer, iPad or iPhone.  Plenzich says her career at Concordia has allowed her to grow, learn and become the person she is today.  I still enjoy my job and I love Concordia.  Fred Szabo: steadfast teacher and former dean Professor of Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Statistics 50 years at Concordia Fred Szabo started his teaching career at Sir George Williams University in the fall of 1964. Over half a century later, Szabo is a full professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.  Concordia allowed me to fulfill my dream of becoming a teacher,  says Szabo, who specializes in the computer-assisted teaching of mathematics. Fred Szabo In 1986, Szabo took on the role of dean of Graduate Studies, and supervised the establishment of many new graduate degrees, including the PhD in Biology, PhD in Mathematics, MSc in Administration and MSc in Aerospace Engineering.  I fought tooth and nail for Concordia to create graduate programs at a time when this was really a big deal,  says Szabo.  These things are now taken for granted. In the late  80s they required finesse, tact and inspiring collaboration.  After Szabo's term, the Senate approved the establishment of a School of Graduate Studies. In  92 Szabo hung up his dean s hat and went back to teaching, which has kept him busy for the last 22 years. During this time, he pioneered online mathematics education.  One of the gratifying aspects of my 51 years of teaching at Concordia is the fact that some colleagues still often greet me as  Dean Szabo.   I must have done something right,  he adds. A lasting tribute to Szabo s work, inspiration and vision is his brainchild, the Prix d excellence of the Association des doyens des  tudes sup rieures au Qu bec (ADESAQ), which recognizes the best PhD thesis written at one of the four universities in Montreal in a given year.  There is always lots of work to be done and lots of opportunities to do it. Where others see obstacles, I see opportunities.

Every year, Math Kangaroo contests around the world attract more than 5 million students. Math education expert  Anna Sierpinska , a professor in Concordia's Department of Mathematics and Statistics , brought the competition to the university in 2012. This year's event is led by PhD candidate Ildiko Pelczer and department administrator Jane Venettacci. What makes the contest special, Pelczer says, is that it's accessible to all young students, regardless of their mathematical abilities.  \"The problems are designed with different levels of difficulty, so everybody can do something. And even though it's not far from the school curriculum, the problems are still formulated in an interesting way, so it's not just plain calculation.\" As Sierpinska points out, the competition is particularly popular among students in elementary school. \"The young children have fun with math, that's it. They have friends there, and they just come and enjoy themselves   playing with children who have the same kinds of interests as they have, thinking about a problem and twisting it around.\" Students who return tend to do better, Pelczer says. \"They come back and they're stronger, so we have better results every year at the national level, not just at the local level.\" There's even a component of the contest for parents who've come to cheer on their children, so they can flex their perhaps long-dormant math muscles. \"It's a compilation of problems to give them a feeling of what it's about,\" Pelczer says.  As asssociate professor  Nadia Hardy  explains, engaging the Montreal community is important to Department of Mathematics and Statistics . \"Whether it's hosting or participating in mathematical competitions for elementary to high school children, or sponsoring mathematical competitions and student-related activities, we are dedicated to continuing our involvement, and finding new ways of increasing our outreach.

The professional web-based service connects businesses wishing to boost their online presence with high-quality freelancers that have the skills to make it happen. It s the brainchild of Liverani and husband Mikael Cho. The couple, ages 26 and 29, co-founded the company three years ago along with partners Luke Chesser and Angus Woodman. The 1,000-square-metre ground-floor space of this historical building, which has retained the original tile, stone and brickwork, will also house a co-working space and caf  when it opens its doors in April 2016.  We have quite a lot of freelancers that are based in Montreal, and we had to get a new office space anyway,  Liverani says.  We figured, let s have a physical presence and show what Crew looks like in the real world.  As chief operating officer, Liverani helps define new product features, assures quality, sets up team processes, is responsible for hiring, and manages investor relations and the future of Crew. Since tripling its staff in 2014   the company now employs upwards of 30 people   she admits that maintaining a good work-life balance is challenging.  There s always something to do. It s about finding that time where you can just think, maybe go for a walk,  says Liverani. For her, this precious personal time is early in the morning when her Chow Chow dog begs to be taken out for a stroll. Staying on top of things takes a lot of self-discipline   a skill Liverani says she learned during her time at Concordia. A lifelong love of math led her to study actuarial mathematics in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics. Motivated by the challenging and fast-paced nature of her studies, she was dismayed when her first job offered little more than a 9-to-5 grind in a tiny cubicle.  What I learned in school was very different than what happened when I graduated and went into the real world of working,  she says. Disillusioned, Liverani decided to make a career change after just one year in the actuarial field. Meanwhile, Cho   a designer   had grown tired of working in an agency and was ready to do something different. With a $25,000 investment from FounderFuel   a Montreal-based startup accelerator that helps young entrepreneurs refine their vision into deliverable products   the couple co-founded Crew in 2012. Last year, the company raised more than $12 million.  In terms of learning how to start a business, it s a lot of trial and error and listening to your gut,  Liverani says.

That ability has certainly helped her in her career with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) LLP in Montreal.   Her experience and expertise has also led Miriam to be named a recipient of the Women s Executive Network s (WXN) 2015 Canada s Most Powerful Women: Top 100 Awards. She was honoured at a gala hosted by the WXN at The Westin Montreal in April. Miriam Pozza is a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in Montreal and leads the Deals practice in Quebec. This year she celebrates a quarter-century with the company. | Photo credit: Claudia Landry  It s always nice to have recognition when you put effort into your work, your personal development and the development of your team,  she says. At Concordia, Pozza studied in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.  I was interested in anything that had to do with numbers and understanding our economy through numbers,  she says.  That s what led me to the world of finance.  Pozza joined the professional services network of PwC in 1991. She says that her passion in assisting entrepreneurs and corporations in their growth has led her into the world of mergers and acquisitions. She s worked determinedly to distinguish herself in this competitive field.   After spending several years in both the auditing and valuation departments   eventually receiving designations as a Chartered Professional Accountant and Chartered Business Valuator   Pozza became Deals leader for the Quebec Region in 2013.   Her main function, she explains, is to help her colleagues work together towards the common goal of accompanying clients in their transactions. Aspects of the job that she finds particularly rewarding are the challenges of completing a deal, and helping companies grow to meet their full potential.   Pozza says her commitment to personal and professional development, coupled with her natural leadership qualities, has made her an important asset to the various organizations she has supported throughout her career.    If you view yourself as fortunate, and I do, I think giving back to the community is rewarding,  she says.   For 10 years, Pozza lent her accounting skills to the YWCA Montreal by acting as a treasurer on its board of directors. She also sits on the fundraising committee of La Fondation Armand-Frappier, a research institute in the life sciences sector.    Medicine and wellbeing were always something that I found of great interest,  she says, adding that her ambition was to become a doctor when she was younger.   Pozza also supports the advancement of women to leadership positions through her directorship with the Quebec Association of Women in Finance (AFFQ). In 2012, the AFFQ awarded her the Recognition Award for her tireless dedication.  I find it important to be part of this association and to specifically assist women in their development, by helping them build a network and develop their skills,  she says.   Described previously by PwC CEO Bill McFarland as a natural mentor, Pozza believes strongly that building a network of mentors helps women develop their careers in the long run.   The best mentors, she says, will take an interest in your values and guide you out of your comfort zone.  Sometimes you need that little push to take some risks.  #CUalumni ", "title": "One of Canada\u2019s most powerful women"},

Studies of infants' cognitive abilities in non-social domains (including object cognition, numerical cognition and spatial cognition) shed light on the starting points for human cognitive development. Together with studies of these cognitive abilities in other animals, at other ages, and with other methods from the cognitive and brain sciences, this research suggests deep properties of physical and mathematical reasoning in older children and adults. Here I ask whether studies of infants can bring similar insights into human social cognition. Do the complex social inferences and intuitions of adults develop from, and build on, simpler systems that are functional in infants? If so, what are the properties of these systems, and what roles do they play in the richer social reasoning that emerges later in development?

Concordia s Institute for Co-operative Education hosted its yearly Co-op Awards of Recognition Event (CARE) in the atrium of the John Molson School of Business (MB) Building on May 19.  This is an opportunity to express our gratitude to our students and admire the accomplishments they've been able to achieve over the last year,  said Gerry Hughes, the institute s director, before handing out more than $10,000 in prizes, awards and scholarships. Hughes went on to thank the many Co-op employers on hand, as well as Concordia staff, faculty and alumni, for playing a key role in the institute s success and continued growth. Students on the move Attendees were greeted by the Co-op Showcase, featuring 25 of the top senior students. They stood beside posters bearing details about their work terms and what they had gained from their various on-the-job experiences. Megan Brown, who graduated from Concordia s computer science program last fall, spent her final work term at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, where she developed an application for a remote-controlled car that can be operated using any Windows 10 device. Brown has accepted a job with the software behemoth, and she s relocating to Washington in a few weeks. Computer engineering student Vincent Bilodeau spent his last work term at the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in Scottsdale, Arizona, optimizing audio effects and performing hardware performance profiling.  It s pretty cool, you get to work on something, then play guitar, work on it a little more, then play some more guitar,  he said, smiling. Bilodeau has a few courses left before he graduates, but he signed a contract for freelance work with Fender this summer, and he s hopeful about his prospects for a future with the company. Accountancy student Nicholas Chin recently completed a work term at the professional services company KPMG where he helped corporate executives with their personal tax returns. He s found his passion, he said. But before looking for his first job after he graduates this spring, he s going to take some time off to travel. The ticket to Italy s already booked.    This year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi (far left) and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau (second from left) shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award. Co-op s $8 million contribution Hughes provided some figures to illustrate the program s growth and diversity: Currently there are more than 40 Co-op programs at Concordia, including three new ones this year, in mathematical and computational finance , biology and aerospace engineering . Close to 1,800 students are enrolled as Co-op members, and they secured 1,400 work placements over the past year. On an annual basis, students in the program earn in the neighbourhood of $8 million.  This helps them with their education, but it also helps the local economy,  Hughes said. A vital bridge Catherine Bolton , Concordia s vice-provost for teaching and learning, compared Co-op to a bridge, connecting the classroom to the workplace.  It results in an increase of possibilities   to communicate, to meet, to work together and to learn from each other,  she said.  This bridge partnership is vital to us, not only at the Co-op institute but also at Concordia.  Bolton underlined the role Co-op s experiential learning opportunities play in Concordia s new strategic directions.   Embrace the city, embrace the world speaks to the idea that Concordians can use their talents, expertise and energy to affect social change and to give back to the community that we live in, whether it's locally or globally,  Bolton said.  It is very clear that Co-op students and Co-op employers have long been helping us to achieve this goal.  Co-op s  win-win  Co-op employer Angela D Angelo, vice-president of training and client experience at National Bank Financial, highlighted the benefits of hiring Co-op students.  It s win-win. It s a two-way street,  she said.  You have no idea what these millennials can bring to your business, to your life and to your development.  This year, journalism undergraduate Casandra De Masi and electrical engineering student Nicholas Boudreau shared the Alexandre Quintal Co-op Student of the Year Award . De Masi said being a part of Co-op allowed her to face her fears and anxieties head on and develop the confidence needed to decide her career direction.  I've learned that it's important not to let people place you in a labelled box and tell you that that s what you have to be in life,  she said.  I'll kick the box open and politely say,  No, thank you.  Boudreau praised Co-op for allowing students to gain invaluable experience while working for employers who take a vested interest in developing their interns.  I really experienced this working on flight simulators and antennas for satellites. It was really remarkable to work with so many employers who would just listen, and be there when you needed help,  he said.  I learned to think a little less like a student and a little more like an engineer, and it reflected in the way that I came back to school.  ", "title": "1,800 avid experiential learners"},

Latimer Four actuarial students from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics are celebrating a big win: they recently took home $20,000 from the second annual 2016 Munich Re Cup . The Munich Re Cup   named after the sponsor, a global reinsurance company   is a national actuarial case competition open to teams from the Society of Actuaries'   Centers of Actuarial Excellence . These are university and college actuarial programs that meet specific  requirements  related to degree, curriculum, graduate count, faculty composition, graduate quality and connection to industry and research.  Concordia is one of eight Centers of Actuarial Excellence across Canada, and 30 worldwide,  says Jos  Garrido , graduate program director and the first actuarial professor hired by Concordia back in 1986.  We re the only English co-operative education program in Quebec.   Winning the cup proves that our program is focusing on the right things,  he says.  It was designed to provide students with an opportunity to develop and apply their analytical, presentation and problem-solving skills to a real-world business problem   And the $20,000 in prize money is pretty nice!  On March 12, students David Tagliamonti, Jasmine Lemay-Dagenais, Roxanne C t  and Ryan D'Orazio represented Concordia in Toronto at Munich Re headquarters, where seven teams competed. Each team was given the same case to solve four weeks beforehand. This year s case was  Specialty Drugs: How Do You Manage the Risk?   Some new drugs are super expensive per treatment,  explains D Orazio, a third-year actuarial student and a member of the Institute for Co-operative Educatio n.  So, how do we handle so many high-cost claims? We proposed providing less coverage for small claims, in a tiered solution that provides peace of mind. In addition, we proposed the implementation of certain drug-cost management strategies to decrease spending for both specialty and traditional drugs. These elements work in harmony to form a solution that is economically sound for the client, affordable for plan sponsors and attractive for plan members.  Each team submitted a one-page executive summary, individual team member profiles and an electronic copy of their presentation.  Munich Re liked that our team focused on the plan member   the end user,  says Tagliamonti, a team member and Co-op student, who is graduating in December.  The experience confirmed my belief that I m going to like a career as an actuary.  Lemay-Dagenais concurs.  Our team had the chance to work on a highly relevant issue to the group benefits insurance industry,  she says.  Having each had different previous work experiences, all of us contributed differently to the project. It was definitely a rewarding experience, and we were able to obtain valuable feedback from the judging panel.  Most of the team members heard about the Munich Re Cup via the student newsletter produced by the Mathematics Actuarial Statistics Student Association (MASSA) .  To apply, we each wrote a one-page essay about why we wanted to compete, then we approached our program director, Patrice Gaillardetz ,  says D Orazio.  I learned so much, like the importance of taking a strong business perspective and taking into account how all parties are affected.  C t  believes that one of the most valuable assets a student can have in her field is experience.  This is mainly why I registered for the Munich Re Cup in the first place, which turned out to be a very gratifying experience,  she says.  Not only have I learned about the reinsurance industry, but I also gained a lot of analytical skills, creativity and confidence.  The burning question: what are the students going to do with their $5,000 prize money?  Invest it safely and wisely!  says Tagliamonti, with a laugh.

In 2014, the university introduced four options in anthropology, sociology, journalism and political science. This fall, it will add new programs in biology and mathematical and computational finance (MACF) to the list of more than 35 experiential opportunities, offered through the Institute for Co-operative Education . MACF:  a very interdisciplinary program  The new MACF Co-op option was years in the making.  It s geared toward modelling and quantitative aspects of finance,  says Cody Hyndman , program director and associate professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics .  Our students take a lot of courses in math and statistics, commerce and finance, computer science, and specialized courses to tie everything together,  he says.  It s a very interdisciplinary program.  Hyndman says the department hopes the new option will complement its successful existing Co-op programs in actuarial mathematics, statistics, and pure and applied mathematics .  The work these students will be doing requires more in-depth knowledge of the advanced mathematics behind some of the models that are used in finance, and really understanding how they work. It s not just, here s a formula and use it,  explains Hyndman. This Co-op program will follow a new model: rather than applying straight out of CEGEP, students will complete one term of courses at Concordia before being eligible for a Co-op schedule with three work terms.  We re going to have students who have more program-specific knowledge when they do their first work term,  says Hyndman of the decision to structure the program differently. Examples of the fields of Co-op work available to students include finance, capital markets, investment banking, treasury, risk management and insurance.  This also allows us to present multiple Co-op options to an employer to make it that much more interesting to partner with us,  explains Gerry Hughes, director of the Institute for Co-operative Education. He s quick to praise Hyndman s and senior program coordinator Nadine Benjamin s efforts to get this new option off the ground.  Cody is a very dynamic leader who is fully committed to our Co-op program,  Hughes says.  His total dedication is very much appreciated. All of these programs have become some of our top  flagship  Co-op programs at Concordia.  Daniel Eklove, BA 13, says this Co-op option provides valuable networking opportunities for students that can translate into future employment offers.  One thing that I've noticed in the couple of years since graduating is that there's a big hole in the financial workforce just waiting to be filled by MACF graduates. But it's not an obvious hole. It's subtle.  Eklove is speaking both as a student and a potential boss.  Now, as an employer, this program is a good opportunity to explore potential future talent while connecting with my alma mater,  he says. Hyndman is looking forward to getting the show on the road.  I think this is going to be a very popular option with students, and one which will help them launch successful careers upon graduating.  Biology:  There is a need for qualified interns  Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, the food industry, environmental testing firms, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, hospitals, universities  there are plenty of places that benefit from biology graduates  scientific expertise. Starting this fall, undergraduates students enrolled in the Department of Biology at Concordia will be able to gain invaluable on-the-job experience during their studies thanks to the department s new Co-op option.  There is a need in industry for qualified interns,  says Madoka Gray-Mitsumune , a senior lecturer in the Department of Biology who spearheaded the creation of the biology Co-op program, one of only two in the province. She says the opportunity to alternate work and study terms will likely attract more top-notch biology undergraduates to Concordia.  What students do outside of the regular curriculum is so important,  she says,  They have to have a good CV when they graduate, because when they start looking for a job, it's already too late.  Lucia Plescia, coordinator at the Institute for Co-operative Education, says the plan is to grow the program sustainably, ensuring that Co-op students are set up with engaging and dynamic work opportunities. She adds that students who do apply will be encouraged to be open to working anywhere in Quebec, Canada or even internationally.  This will enhance and diversify the quality of work terms as well as provide enriching life experiences,\" she says. Gray-Mitsumune agrees that flexibility is key, pointing out the federal government s need for qualified interns to carry out research in the field.  One example might be a station in Mont-Joli that hires undergraduate students for fish studies.    To be eligible for the biology Co-op program, students must be enrolled in a specialization or honours program and have a CRC (La cote de rendement au coll gial) score of 28.00 or higher. However, even students who meet the requirements are not guaranteed admittance to the program. Those who want to find out more about the selection process are encouraged to contact the institute. The biology Co-op option consists of six study terms and three work terms, completed consecutively over a three-year period, including summer terms.  We are always looking to increase the depth and breadth of experiential learning opportunities for students,  says Hughes.  We were delighted to provide the support to both departments in getting these programs up and running, and obviously we re all excited to begin accepting the first cohort and preparing them for future academic and professional success.

Hard work, commitment to excellence and a few sleepless nights   these are just some of the ingredients necessary to be an Arts and Science Scholar . On October 5, a group of 151 of the best and brightest students from the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS) were recognized for their exemplary academic achievements. Concordia's Graham Carr , provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs, and Andr  Roy , dean of FAS, were among those celebrating the students. The cohort includes those whose grades are in the top one per cent of their respective programs. This year, 90 per cent of Arts and Science Scholars have a GPA of 4.00 or higher, with eight scoring a perfect 4.3.  This truly is a group of exceptional individuals, one that inspires us in the Faculty of Arts and Science,  said Roy.  I believe that these students represent a new generation of scholar. Their talents go well beyond their academic excellence or their mastery of a field of study; they also engage meaningfully in their community to make a change.  Three of this year s honoured scholars provided a few of their top tips for scholarly success. David Tagliamonti Bachelor of Science   Actuarial Mathematics Member of the Institute for Co-operative Education Three keys to a good education: Make a reading/homework/study schedule in week one of your term and stick to it. Push yourself to ask \"why?\" This will deepen your understanding of course material. Stay healthy. Regularly playing a sport or going to the gym will keep your mind sharp and help you stay focused in school. Two lessons learned at FAS: A problem often has many solutions. The science is in finding a solution; the art is in finding the best one. University is a great time to learn from others   not just professors, but fellow students as well. One piece of advice for other students: Keep learning long after your formal education comes to an end. Cristy Vista Member of the Institute for Co-operative Education Three keys to a good education: Listen earnestly to your professors when they give a lecture, and to your colleagues when they share their thoughts. Understanding others can widen our own perspective. Don't let confusion build up   it can hamper learning. Clarify concepts or processes you don't understand as soon as you hear about them. Learning should not be a lonely process. When you're having a hard time, ask for help. Concordia has many resources you can tap. Two lessons learned at FAS: Information is never neutral. It must not be simply digested, but carefully examined and reflected on. The world is built in a way that we are unequal and completely reliant on each other. The comforts we may have are at the expense of others, and this makes us our brother s keeper. One piece of advice for other students: Studying to just get the grade can be tedious and off-putting. Relate your coursework to your passions, long-term goals and aspirations. This approach can give you encouragement during difficult times.    Bachelor of Arts   Linguistics Three keys to a good education: First off, it requires professors that not only teach what they love, but who teach you how to think critically and nurture high-quality ignorance. In other words, they teach you how to express your curiosity in meaningful and practical ways. A good education is one that helps you develop skills that will serve you throughout your entire life. Finally, it involves a network of people that constantly encourage and motivate you to thrive. Two lessons learned at FAS: There are many resources in place to help us succeed at Concordia. We are fortunate to have advisors, committees and activities for everyone. I also learned to take classes from different departments. FAS has hundreds of different courses offered. This allows us to view the world from multiple perspectives. One piece of advice to fellow students: Be resilient and passionate   the rest will follow!
