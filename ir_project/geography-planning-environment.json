Many employers are looking for people trained in high-tech sub-fields such as computer assisted cartography, remote sensing and GIS. Environmental problems have become the concern of government officials and citizens alike. Because of catastrophes involving toxic waste, air and water pollution, loss of biodiversity and habitat, and soil erosion, great care is now being taken to monitor the delicate balance between nature and the human use of the earth. Every major project now requires an assessment of its social and environmental impact, creating a large demand for geographers able to integrate the work of specialists in both the social and natural sciences. Most students completing the BA Specialization or Honours Urban Planning intend to work in some area of the planning field. Certain students upon graduation find employment with municipal, parapublic or private consulting agencies, generally in technical or support areas. Others continue at the Master's level at other universities; in these cases, the Specialization or Honours degree can be an additional advantage in the competition for the limited number of places in graduate schools and a sufficiently high GPA is a must. A double Major or Major-Minor combination can be useful in keeping one's options open after the Bachelor's degree or may simply offer a way of studying in several disciplines. Planners work in municipal, regional and provincial planning departments as well as for school and medical services boards, public housing agencies and municipal administration. Planning in the private sector of the economy is done by real estate development firms, consulting firms working for development companies, retailing chains, industrial or office location firms. Opportunities also exist in institutional planning at the management level. While the purposes and subject areas vary widely, similar approaches and methods are found in all of these work environments. Students who intend to work in the town planning field should take special note of the following legal restrictions: the Ordre des urbanistes du Qu bec (OUQ) will admit graduates of certain Qu bec and Canadian programmes of study, upon completion of a two-year supervised stage and an entry examination. Completion of the Bachelor's degree at Concordia cannot lead to membership in the OUQ, which confers the exclusive right in Qu bec to call oneself a \"planner\" or \"urbaniste\". Membership is rarely required by employers although it is sometimes said to be useful in setting up a consultancy. Elsewhere in Canada, the voluntary association is the Canadian Institute of Planners/Institut canadien des urbanistes and their provincial affiliates which also accredit programmes of study and admit members, although planners there are also not required to become members and may call themselves \"planners\" or \"urbanistes\" without membership. For a list of accredited planning programmes at the undergraduate and graduate level in Canada and the US, go to www.cip-icu.ca  (\"Student Zone\" and then \"University Programs\"). The CIP-ICU website also has job listings under the heading \"Employment Services\"); for US jobs one place to look is http://www.planetizen.com/jobs. It is usual in the town planning field for formally trained planners to work alongside architects and landscape architects with little professional distinction. Other planners do not have their own professional association and will be seen as technical advisors or administrators by their respective working organizations. Other graduates will be interested in policy analysis and public administration, for which a broadly based background in Urban Studies can be seen as sound preparation. For these students it would be desirable to increase the number of 300- and 400-level courses in Economics, Political Science and Geography as part of the elective load. Private corporations also employ policy analysts, for which an understanding of finance, business practice and management is an asset. Students wishing to fill technical positions in the private and public sectors involved with services provided to the public should acquire analytical skill using computer, computer mapping and geographical information systems (GIS). Technical positions in planning increasingly require knowledge of computer-assisted design and GIS. Environmental impact assessment where humans, landscapes, architectural heritage or esthetics are concerned will often be carried out by planners or allied professionals from architecture and geography. The Urban Studies courses are intended to provide the theory, the historical and legal background required for application in the field. All courses involve the development of analytical skills useful in a great number of work areas not specially mentioned above. The prospects for job placement change with economic cycles. There are niches of significantly greater demand that may not be lasting. Flexibility that comes from broad preparation is important but good analytical and communication skills are more important. Ultimately employers are most interested in the specific skills, interest and abilities you bring to their environment. Environmental science training prepares you for many types of careers with a wide variety of employers in the private, public and academic sectors such as, climatology environmental impact assessment, resource conservation, urban and regional planning, housing and community development, environmental consultant, Geographic Information Systems analyst, water scientist, teaching.

Urban Planning provides courses involving field studies, planning projects and the acquisition of technical skills. The programs provide a foundation for further studies in planning or related fields and training for work in the planning, real estate, and social service fields. A transfer into BA Urban Planning (Specialization) from another program requires a cumulative GPA of at least 2.7 on a 4.3 scale. The BA Urban Planning (Honours) requires the completion of a thesis based on research carried out by the student under the supervision of a professor. Transfer into the Honours program requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 on a 4.3 scale. Exchange Agreements and Study Abroad Concordia University has a number of official exchange agreements with universities abroad. For example, the agreement with the University of Dundee in Scotland has allowed Concordia students to study there for one year while paying Qu bec tuition fees. The year of study there can be fully credited toward a year of study (30 credits) at Concordia. Study abroad should only be contemplated in the second year of a three-year program. Under a global exchange agreement covering all Qu bec universities, it is also possible to undertake a year of study in a French university and have these studies fully credited toward the Bachelor's degree at Concordia. Each case will be examined separately. French universities charge modest tuition fees but students are expected to be fully self-supporting. German universities will also accommodate visiting students but it will be necessary to pass a German language proficiency test upon arrival. Concordia International has an expanding roster of universities which can be attended by Concordia students. Visit Concordia International  for a listing of our current partner institutions. Libraries in Montreal The planning collections of the four universities in Montreal are accessible to Concordia students. Journals are sometimes carried by more than one institution but many journals are only available at one university. Undergraduate students may borrow only from Concordia University but you may consult the extensive collections at, for example, Blackader-Lauterman Library at McGill or the Biblioth que de l'am nagement at the Universit  de Montr al. Urban Studies students may also become student members of the Canadian Centre for Architecture. Membership will grant you discounts on purchases and entry to the Centre. You may also visit (and browse) their excellent bookstore. You may also arrange to consult documents in the specialized library of the CCA. McGill's bookstore also carries an interesting range of titles. One of the better bookstores carrying planning and architecture titles is Olivieri.

Modern liberal capitalism is exposing what has always been true: that it is shaped by the anxious memory of revolution, and thus by a consciousness of the potential, the menace   however isolated or consistently unrealized   of popular rejection of the existing order. The immanent critique of liberalism s failures, from Hegel to Keynes to Piketty, has developed in a house haunted by Robespierre. A reexamination of the Jacobin's revolutionary moment of rupture has much to teach us about the very conditions of possibility of political economy. For if political economy is the science of (the) liberal capitalist government   which it surely is   then it is the science of crisis, the knowledge of those confronting the unrelenting fact of poverty in the midst of their plenty.

Damon Matthews:  A fantastic opportunity.  This is the question to which Damon Matthews , Concordia University Research Chair for Climate Science and Sustainability and professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment , has dedicated himself for well over a decade. Considered a leader in his field, Matthews researches climate systems, climate change and environmental modelling. Now this work has earned him a top national honour   membership in the Royal Society of Canada s College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists . Formed in 2014 to recognize intellectual leaders and pioneers in Canada from a variety of fields, the college already boasts the membership of four Concordia researchers   Steven High , Erin Manning and Vincent Martin were included in the inaugural cohort, and Muthukumaran Packirisamy was inducted last year. Matthews is immensely honoured to represent Concordia within the college.  This is a fantastic opportunity to meet and interact with a group of really interesting young scholars and researchers,  Matthews says.  I m especially grateful to Concordia for their role in putting my nomination forward   this university has been a wonderful environment in which to build my academic career, and I would like to thank the many people here who have supported me both personally and professionally.  Through his research, Matthews has shown how each emission of carbon dioxide leads to a discrete and essentially irreversible increase in world temperatures. This work has improved understandings of the science of climate change, its impacts on human and environmental systems and how best to respond to the challenge of climate mitigation.  Recognition from a prestigious body like the Royal Society of Canada is extremely gratifying,  says Graham Carr, interim provost and vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.  The fact that Concordia faculty members continue to receive this honour is a further demonstration of the important contributions that our research makes to the betterment of Canadian society.  Concordia is also the institutional sponsor of the College, a tribute to the university's commitment to next-generation researchers.

Concordia professor  Zachary Patterson  is teaming up with the City of Montreal to launch MTLTrajet , a mobile app that will help the city learn more about how its citizens navigate from point A to point B.  I wanted to be able to undertake transportation and land-use research using emerging data sources,  says Patterson, an associate professor of geography, planning and environment in the  Faculty of Arts and Science.  However, getting ahold of this kind of data proved difficult. So, using smartphones, I developed an app to collect my own data.  DataMobile The app initially launched as  DataMobile , a 2014 pilot project. Close to 900 people downloaded the app, which prompted them to take part in a survey before it recorded their trips throughout the day using their smartphone. Developed at Concordia s  TRIP Lab , the app asked users for information such as their purpose of travel and chosen mode of transport.  Its purpose was to test how well we can use smartphones to collect travel data for transportation planning purposes,  says Patterson. The app proved popular, and was used in studies as far away as Ghana. Closer to home, it will be used in five Canadian cities   Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax   as part of this fall's  Canada Food Study . MTLTrajet The City of Montreal became interested when Patterson was a mentor at  MTL Cycle Challenge  (MCC), an initiative designed to improve cycling in the city by using data sets to create urban mobility solutions. At MCC, Patterson discussed the DataMobile project with representatives from the city's transport department and the  Montr al, Smart City  initiative.  The city is very enthusiastic about the adoption of new technologies in transport-related data collection,  says Patterson. After he was invited to give a presentation on DataMobile for city officials, they asked him to use it as the basis of MTLTrajet. In advance of its October 17 launch, the app is already generating plenty of buzz, on the streets and at City Hall.  It has been great working with the city,  says Patterson.  Converting data to information How will the results help advance Patterson s research? MTLTrajet will help Patterson and other researchers  figure out how to convert mere data to information.   It s a potentially effective tool because almost everyone carries around smartphones that know where they are, which can collect crucial transportation data,  says Patterson. He emphasizes the app s data collection is transparent.  The process is completely overt, so that respondents will know what data is being collected from them.  In the long term, Patterson s goal is to gather enough data to develop algorithms that will make it unnecessary to have any user input at all. Additional studies are already being planned by the University of Toronto, the  Institut national de recherche scientifique  s Montreal office, the  Agence m tropolitaine de transport ,  BIXI , the  STM  and the  Quebec  Ministry of Transport .  A travel survey collection effort is also being developed in Lahore, Pakistan. So, if you ve spent your summer playing Pok mon GO and are craving a new smartphone pastime while out and about, MTLTrajet may just be your new fall fix.  They both operate on smartphones and keep track of the location of the phone,  admits Patterson.  But it is different, in that it's not a game   and uses less battery, I hope!  MTLTrajet launches on October 17.

Clarence Epstein, senior director of Urban and Cultural Affairs at Concordia, points out that people have come together around the university   in Stanley Cup parades, demonstrations, performances and cultural events   mostly in spaces not designed as gathering places.  Following the construction of Cabot Square in the late 19th century, very little priority was given to public space planning,  he says.  What we recognize as gathering places have appeared as a result of the way the neighbourhood has evolved. They ve been appropriated by the various people and organizations who live in and occupy these spaces.   Proactive changes  Now, the planning of new public areas is a priority for the city s administration and local stakeholders, including the university. In tandem with the new exhibition, Concordia joined with the City of Montreal s Department of Public Works to launch a visioning charrette to engage the entire community in determining the future of the alley that runs south of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) between Mackay and Bishop streets. A charrette is a participatory design program allowing professionals, scholars and students to join community stakeholders in discussing and visualizing the possibilities for an urban space.  We understand from the City of Montreal that this space is going to change,  Epstein says, noting that municipal officials have also placed a reserve on an adjacent parcel of land slated for a park at the corner of Mackay and Ste-Catherine streets.  The goal of the charrette and other initiatives like it is to inform good design decisions through collective reflection and communication.  The LB Alley charrette took place on October 21 and 22 in the LB atrium, J.A. DeS ve Cinema and in the alley itself. The public was invited to engage in  planning-in-situ,  with walks-through, video-photographic analysis and community sketches. Discussions were led by Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor of geography, planning and environment in the Faculty of Arts and Science . He says the process encourages the public to plan spaces for themselves   from the spaces, because they are the ultimate users. From Modernism to democratization De la Llata explains that in the first half of the 20th century, the dominant approach to urban planning was Modernism, in which form followed the function architects believed spaces should have, rather than the way they were actually used. Modernist planners felt they knew best how people should behave, and built cities designed to coerce citizens into using spaces as they intended them to. According to De la Llata, this resulted in a wide array of urban planning disasters.  Modernist planning transformed cities in a way that wasn t very democratic,  he says.  The motivation here is democratization. We want to understand what qualities people want to see in the space, and to give a chance to Montrealers, the Concordia community, St. Jax Church, McKibbins Irish Pub and other restaurants and businesses on the periphery of the alley to participate in the planning and design of the space.

Damon Matthews is a geography, planning and environment professor and Concordia University Research Chair (Climate Science and Sustainability) in the Faculty of Arts and Science . Following the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on November 4, Matthews co-authored* an op-ed about what it will take for Canada to uphold its commitment to combatting climate change. The Paris Agreement was ratified earlier this month and is unprecedented amongst international agreements for how quickly it has come into force. This agreement allows each country to decide how it will tackle climate change and requires, as of 2020, regular reporting on progress. Countries of the world have officially embarked on a global race to implement ambitious climate policies that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the planetary scale. This process is not unlike the Olympic Games where countries get together to compare their strengths and performance. If Canada wants to be a medalist in 2020, domestic climate policies must rapidly be adopted to accelerate the low carbon transition. In this context, Sustainable Canada Dialogues   a network of 60+ scholars from across Canada   produced a progress report on the country s climate actions over the past year. We analyzed climate decisions made in Ottawa in 2016 in relationship to the 10 policy orientations that we proposed previously in our position paper entitled Acting on Climate Change: Solutions from Canadian Scholars . Canada took two important steps forward. First, the federal government will price carbon throughout the country starting in 2018. Second, the $120 billion infrastructure investment plan explicitly highlights support for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This investment plan raises hopes that Canada can make the transition to low carbon development, but its real impact depends on identifying and funding infrastructure projects that best contribute to desired low-carbon and sustainable outcomes. Despite this progress, the decision to approve the Pacific NorthWest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is a step backward, casting doubt on the willingness of the federal government to meaningfully tackle climate change. The impact assessment indicates that this LNG project would be one of the largest point source of emissions in Canada and would increase British Columbia s emissions by 8.5 per cent. Continued development of projects with high greenhouse gas emissions will compromise progress in other sectors. It will prevent Canada from meeting its emissions reduction target for 2030, and is incompatible with Canada s stated goal to help limit global temperature increases to 1.5oC. Research indeed estimates that, to maintain global temperature increase below 2oC, half of existing gas reserves and one third of existing oil ones must remain unused. Canadian climate policy must tackle the most difficult question: how to transition away from fossil fuels? We call for federal political leadership that steadily and strategically adopts innovative low-carbon tools to drive future economic growth. This requires engaging with a broad range of stakeholders from the oil and gas industry, unions, Indigenous peoples, environmental NGOs, the clean technology sector and academia to discuss how to reorient subsidies away from the fossil fuel industry, promote transitions to low-carbon energy, while ensuring that workers from the oil and gas industry can transition their skills to other sectors. Ambitious Canadian climate leadership is necessary more than ever in North America. Only by working together and building commitment across all sectors will Canada live up to the expectations it rose by joining the High Ambition Coalition in 2015. Despite positive steps, the federal government has been unable so far to develop a coherent climate action plan largely because of its inability to address fossil fuels coherently.

The challenge? Climate On November 30, the Montreal Summit on Innovation will seek to find ways to build more resilient cities Posted on November 11, 2015 |  Adding 2.5 billion to urban populations by 2050, which is the projection, means building 2,500 cities of one million people each, within 35 years.  | Photo by Christopher F (Flickr Creative Commons) How should we reinvent the city in the face of climate change? That s the question driving the fifth edition of the Montr al Summit on Innovation (SMI 2015) taking place on Monday, November 30, at the Palais des congr s de Montr al . The conference was organized by the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, while Concordia set this year s theme, Climate (of) Change: Cities, People and Prosperity, and staff and faculty from the Office of Research developed the programming. Academics, decision makers and scientists will address the anticipated repercussions of climate change, as well as review exemplary practices in the areas of risk management strategy, investment and urban planning and social innovation. Alan Shepard , Concordia s president, will provide opening remarks, and 16 experts in their respective fields will lead sessions. David Suzuki is speaking in the early evening, as part of the Bell International Leaders series. Climate change:  also a huge business opportunity  The relationship between population growth and climate is a hot conference topic.  Adding 2.5 billion to urban populations by 2050, which is the projection, means building 2,500 cities of one million people each, within 35 years,  says conference speaker Paul Shrivastava , executive director of Concordia s Future Earth and the David O'Brien Distinguished Professor of Sustainable Enterprise at Concordia's John Molson School of Business .  Climate change will impact this rapid urbanization, and urbanization will impact climate. This is both a huge threat and also a huge business opportunity.  Shrivastava stresses that building the necessary urban infrastructure to house future generations will require good trans-disciplinary scientific understanding of the challenges, and visionary business and political leadership. A fully decarbonized economy The conference will include a scientific overview of the history of climate change by Damon Matthews , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability.  Climate action has been an international priority for more than 25 years and we ve delayed far too long,  says Matthews.  It is critical that we set a course now toward a fully decarbonized economy.   The magnitude of the climate challenge is staggering. We need to be off fossil fuels within half a century, and this will require action and innovation in every sector of our society. Here in Canada, our energy-policy decisions have been at direct odds with the priorities of climate action. The time has come to align our national energy policies with this new reality.\" In response to the serious nature of environmental warnings, the conference will conclude with a presentation of examples of innovative commercial, social and technological initiatives to deal with climate change. A challenge for humanity  The battle for climate change is, and will be, a challenge for humanity,  says Damien Sil s, executive director of Quartier de l innovation.  There s no plan B. The SMI is the Canadian forum on this subject in 2015, offering a foundation for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) this year.  Sil s is impressed with the conference lineup.  We ve attracted world-renowned speakers, and we hope to sensitize politicians and the business community to the major impact of the actual climate upheaval.   Now we re moving into action  Michel Leblanc, president and chief executive officer of the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, says he s pleased to be taking part in organizing the Montreal Summit on Innovation for the second year.  In the past, efforts went into raising awareness about climate change. Now we are moving into action,  he says.  Greenhouse gas emissions targets and the investments announced in Qu bec s Green Fund will create business opportunities. The Montreal Summit on Innovation will spotlight these opportunities, along with the economic impact of climate change on Montreal and all of Quebec.  Students must register by phone, and their tickets are $85. Adult tickets are between $275 and $350. Admission to David Suzuki s talk starts at $35.

As vice president of the Freshwater program at World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF-Canada), Snider is overseeing the first centralized database of Canadian freshwater and its biggest threats. WWF-Canada recently rolled out the benchmarking project Watershed Reports: Taking the Pulse of Canada s Rivers. The interactive website provides a timely assessment of Canada s 25 major watersheds   the interconnected rivers, wetlands and lakes that drain into a common body of water. The World Wildlife Fund's Watershed Reports is an online tool that reports the health of Canada's water systems. | Courtesy: World Wildlife Fund The user-friendly tool aims to convey information clearly, for all to understand. It appeals to scientists, recreational outdoor enthusiasts and even schoolchildren. It shows completed assessments for half of Canada s watersheds and WWF-Canada estimates it will complete the remainder by 2017. Watershed Reports assesses the health of a water system based on water flow, water quality, bugs and fish. Seven criteria are used to rank threats: pollution, climate change, overuse of water, alteration of flows, invasive species and habitat loss and fragmentation. Concordia experience paved the way Snider says his graduate diploma in environmental assessment helped prepare him for his role as the project s leader. James Snider, GrDip 07, leads the WWF-Canada Watershed Reports project.  At Concordia I was lucky to get a nature conservation internship, because that served as my bridge into the not-for-profit environmental sector,  he says.  I learned hard skills and soft skills that landed me a job with WWF six months after graduating.  A teacher s assistant while at Concordia, Snider started out at WWF-Canada as a data-crunching geographic information system analyst. Now he supervises a Canada-wide team of specialists from WWF-Canada headquarters in Toronto. Although he considers himself more of a technician than a science communicator, he engages with different types of organizations, from conservation groups to government monitoring programs.  I m involved in projects at various levels across the country,  Snider says.  They pave the way for community programs and data collection to take place.  Canadians taking responsibility for water systems Recently the conservation sector has been focusing on empowering individuals and groups to help with large-scale projects such as Watershed Reports.  We re formatting a network approach,  Snider explains. He points to the importance of cross-organizational collaboration.  Citizen scientists, community groups, recreational campers and manufacturing plants all have a role to play in nature conservation.  The report s strong foundation of data will make it easier for advocacy organizations to inform high-level decision makers in policy and best-business practices. The goal is to have all of Canada s watersheds rated as  good condition  by 2025   although most of the watersheds assessed so far show concerning threat levels. Watershed Reports challenges Canadians to act. Its interactive map also displays volunteering and clean-up opportunities.  We want to see a broad audience log on to Watershed Reports, from a family of recreational campers to a construction company CEO,  Snider says.  Ultimately, we hope to provide better local water management from a national online platform.  #CUalumni ","title":"Fresh information on Canadian freshwater"},{"url":"http://www.concordia.ca/artsci/geography-planning-environment/news/cunews/main/stories/2015/10/07/why-canada-needs-to-transition-to-a-low-carbon-economy-and-how.html","body":"A low-carbon economy 'for a future that's worthwhile' On October 15, climate-change crusader Catherine Potvin brings her message to Concordia Posted on October 7, 2015 | By: Elisabeth Faure  We want a plan to meet the target, and currently Canada does not have one   there s a target with no plan.\" A group of experts says Canada needs to act now to reduce carbon emissions, or the next generation of citizens will live in a world defined by extreme climate warming. In the final countdown to the federal election, and in advance of the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference , the Sustainable Canada Dialogues (SCD) research project is challenging Canadians and political leaders to step up their environmental game. The initiative s goal? To begin Canada s transition to a low-carbon economy. Catherine Potvin, a forest ecologist and the 2012 winner of the Royal Society of Canada s Miroslaw Romanowski Medal for scientific work relating to environmental problems, has been spearheading the SCD research project for three years. On Thursday, October 15, Concordia s Science College will host the McGill Biology professor, who holds the Canada Research Chair on Climate Change Mitigation and Tropical Forests, as part of its public lecture series. Potvin's lecture,  Acting on Climate Change: Mobilizing Society to Find Solutions,  will summarize the results of the SCD consultations, during which the group spoke to more than 60 researchers from all ten provinces. The researchers, representing fields ranging from engineering to business to philosophy, were asked to come up with solutions that will allow Canada to begin its transition to a low-carbon economy. The group has put forward 10 key recommendations. Chief among them is a national tax on carbon.  We think this is a fundamental one, you can consider it the floor under our feet,  says Potvin. The price of carbon would be identical across all the provinces, something most political parties have been reluctant to endorse thus far in the election. SCD wants to see low-carbon electricity across Canada, a goal Potvin says can be achieved by 2035. The group is also calling for this kind of power to become Canada s major source of energy for buildings, transportation and industry. Although some might consider them lofty, Potvin says these targets are possible to reach, adding that in her cross-country presentations to unions, First Nations groups and industry representatives, the goals were met enthusiastically.  When we launched this document, many people were quite pessimistic, and thinking we would have no traction,  says Potvin.  I ended up giving interviews coast to coast   and I was always met with the same comment:  Hey, Professor. What you re suggesting makes a lot of sense. Why aren t we doing it?  On the political side, SCD is trying to draw attention to what different parties are promising in advance of the October 19 election. Damon Matthews , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability, contributed to Potvin s project to analyze political parties  climate platforms.  SCD is a very impressive effort to bring such a diverse group of academics together to envision a more sustainable Canada.  Potvin calls Canada s current carbon-reduction program a  smokescreen.   What we want is a plan to meet the target, and currently Canada does not have one   there s a target with no plan,  she says. It s something SCD hopes will change with the next government. Beyond political or scientific concerns, Potvin has a personal desire to see the project succeed.  I have a granddaughter, and two grandsons,  she says.  It s my way of doing what I can to ensure that they have a future that is worthwhile.    Catherine Potvin s lecture,  Acting on Climate Change: Mobilizing Society to Find Solutions,  will take place at the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall on the Loyola Campus (7141 Sherbrooke W.) on Thursday, October 15, at 8 p.m. Find out more about the Science College public lecture series .

The World Science Forum has convened every two years since 2001, in an effort to bring together leading scientists, international science organizations, science advisors and political decision makers. The goal of this year s forum, held last week in Budapest, was to promote the  Enabling Power of Science  by highlighting the role and potential of science to inform solutions to current global challenges. One important set of global challenges is articulated in the  Sustainable Development Goals,  which were ratified by the United Nations in September of this year. There are 17 global goals, which cover development priorities such as decreasing world poverty and hunger, improving access to water, health services and sustainable energy, addressing gender and other inequalities, promoting environmental protection, and encouraging action on climate change. Breaking silos A common theme of the discussions and presentations in Budapest was the interconnection between these goals and their many individual targets, and the need to break silos and stimulate collaboration across disciplines to generate innovative solutions.  As a climate scientist, I came to the World Science Forum with an interest in learning about how climate change science could contribute to global sustainability and development challenges. Climate change will likely have its most serious and dangerous consequences in developing countries. These impacts will exacerbate existing challenges, and in the long term could compromise our ability to achieve many of the sustainable development goals. But the details of these interactions between changes and other sustainability targets are complex and not well understood; the ways that changing patterns of rainfall, extreme weather and high temperatures could affect poverty, inequality, food and water security, health, migration, conflict, access to energy and overall economic development remain highly uncertain, and in some cases largely unknown. There is considerable potential for silo-breaking trans-disciplinary research to shed light on these questions. Climate action and sustainable development In the opening plenary of the conference, I was therefore quite dismayed to hear the idea of climate action dismissed as being an ineffective way to address global sustainability challenges, and a low priority compared to other more urgent needs. Bjorn Lomborg, president and founder of the Copenhagen Consensus Center , argued that investments in climate action would detract from potential investments in other development challenges such as poverty alleviation or improvements in health services. The clear implication of his argument was that we need to emphasize action on development priorities by using the most cost-effective strategies currently available to us, without worrying too much about the effects of these strategies on development s climate footprint. Lomborg s argument was a clear example of thinking that did not acknowledge the interactions between climate and sustainable development, nor the potentially very severe long-term climate impacts on the most vulnerable human societies. The magnitude of the climate challenge   that we need to eliminate the global use of fossil fuels within the next half-century   requires immediate action on decarbonization in developed countries, in addition to the mobilization of a tremendous amount of financial resources to assist with the development of sustainable energy technologies in the world s poorest countries. Of course there are urgent development needs that could be met now without addressing climate change; but to use this as an argument to dismiss climate action altogether is to trade off the future to meet the needs of the present generation. This is fundamentally at odds with the very essence of sustainable development. A lack of real engagement There were other, more progressive perspectives offered by other speakers in other sessions of the conference, and the declaration produced by the conference organizers did include a clear call to action on both climate change and the sustainable development goals. But I remained struck by a lack of real engagement between the climate research community and the discussion of what is needed to meet the very real and pressing needs of low- and middle-income countries. I think there is a real need to fill this gap, and to engage more actively on questions of how climate change research can be used to motivate and inform not just action on climate change, but also the ways that we seek to address other sustainable development goals. World Science Forum 2017 At the closing ceremony in Budapest, we were addressed by Princess Sumaya bint El Hassan of the royal family of Jordan, who will be hosting the next World Science Forum in 2017. She gave a remarkable speech, one that managed to be both critical and empowering in equal measure, and I was left feeling both inspired and excited to see what new ideas and perspectives would be brought to this next meeting. But one message from her address in particular resonated with me: that the most potent threat to global sustainability is short-term thinking.  Damon Matthews is an associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability. In 2014 he received the award for Research Communicator of the Year (International) for his work in identifying the world s greatest contributors to climate change .  His research is aimed at better understanding the many possible interactions between human activities, natural ecosystems and future climate change, and contributing to the scientific knowledge base required to promote the development of sound national and international climate policy.

Concordia research shows which countries are most responsible for the cost of environmental damage from global warming Posted on September 8, 2015 | By: Cl a Desjardins All countries have contributed to recent climate change, but some much more so than others. Those that have contributed more than their fair share have accumulated a climate debt, owed to countries that have contributed less to historical warming. This is the implication of a new study published in Nature Climate Change, in which Concordia University researcher Damon Matthews shows how national carbon and climate debts could be used to decide who should pay for the global costs of climate mitigation and damages. The countries that have accumulated the largest carbon debts on account of higher than average per-capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. The U.S. alone carries 40 per cent of the cumulative world debt, while Canada carries about four per cent. On the other side, the carbon creditors   those whose share of CO2 emissions has been smaller than their share of world population   are India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, Brazil and China, with India holding 30 per cent of the total world credit.   Thinking of climate change in terms of debts and credits for individual countries shows how much countries have over- or under-contributed to historical warming, relative to their proportion of the world s population over time,  explains Matthews, study author and associate professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment.  This paints a striking picture of the historical inequalities among countries with respect to their greenhouse gas emissions and consequent responsibility for climate changes.  Calculating climate responsibility To estimate differences in national responsibility for historical climate changes, Matthews first calculated carbon debts and credits based on fossil fuel CO2 emission and population records since 1990. It was around this date that scientific knowledge and public understanding of the dangers of human-driven climate changes began to solidify. Since that time, the total carbon debt across all debtor nations has increased to 250 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. And it s still going up: the increase in world carbon debt in 2013 alone was 13 billion tonnes, or about 35 per cent of global CO2 emissions in that year. So what is the monetary value of this debt?  According to a recent U.S. government report, the current best estimate of the social cost of present-day CO2 emissions is about $40 USD per tonne of CO2,  says Matthews.  Multiply $40 by the 13 billion tonnes of carbon debt accrued in 2013, and you get $520 billion. This cost estimate gives us an indication of how much we could be paying to help lower-emitting countries cope with the costs of climate changes, or develop their economies along carbon-free pathways.  Looking at the total world carbon debt, the numbers are even more staggering: the 250 billion tonnes of debt accumulated since 1990, at $40 per tonne, represents $10 trillion USD.  No matter how you look at this picture, these numbers are really big   much, much larger than even the most generous financial commitments currently pledged by countries to help with the cost of climate adaptation and damages in vulnerable countries.  CO2 emissions vs. degrees of debt Matthews also calculated how much each country has over- or under-contributed to temperature increases as a result of a range of different greenhouse gas emissions. By this measure, the total accumulated world climate debt comes to 0.1 C since 1990, close to a third of observed warming over this period of time. Again the U.S. is the single largest debtor, and India is the largest creditor. Some countries, however, like Brazil and Indonesia, switch from being carbon creditors, to being among the climate debtor countries, as a result of the additional greenhouse gas emissions produced by deforestation and agriculture.  This idea of climate and carbon debts and credits highlight the large historical inequalities with respect to how much individual countries have contributed to climate warming,  says Matthews.  The historical debts and credits calculated here could be a helpful tool to inform policy discussions relating to historical responsibility and burden sharing, by providing a measure of who should pay  and how much they might be expected to pay   for the costs of mitigation and climate damages in countries with lower emissions.  What does this mean for the upcoming Paris meetings? As countries continue to announce their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (or INDCs) leading up to December s climate talks in Paris, it is becoming increasingly clear that these emissions pledges will not be enough to meet the international goal of limiting global warming to 2 C (see related research by Matthews  research group published last month in Environmental Research Letters ). The idea of additionally accounting for debts and credits would of course increase the burden placed on countries with high historical emissions.  But these historical inequalities are real and substantial, and need to be fully acknowledged,  says Matthews.  My hope is that this discussion will help lead to a stronger and more meaningful global climate agreement.    Find out more about research in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment .

When it comes to global warming, there are seven big contributors: the United States, China, Russia, Brazil, India, Germany and the United Kingdom. A new study published in Environmental Research Letters reveals that these countries were collectively responsible for more than 60 per cent of pre-2005 global warming. Uniquely, it also assigns a temperature-change value to each country that reflects its contribution to observed global warming. The study was conducted at Concordia under the leadership of Damon Matthews, an associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment. In a straight ranking, the U.S. is an unambiguous leader, responsible for a global temperature increase of 0.15 C. That s close to 20 per cent of the observed warming. China and Russia account for around eight per cent each; Brazil and India seven per cent; and Germany and the U.K. around five per cent each. Canada comes in tenth place, right after France and Indonesia. Although it may seem surprising that less industrialized countries, including Brazil and Indonesia, ranked so highly, their positions reflect carbon dioxide emissions related to deforestation. In the study, the research team used a new methodology to calculate national contributions to global warming. It weighted each type of emission according to the atmospheric lifetime of the temperature change it caused. Using data from 1750 onward, the team accounted for carbon dioxide contributions from fossil fuel burning and land-use change, along with methane, nitrous oxide and sulphate aerosol emissions. Matthews and his colleagues also experimented with scaling the emissions to the size of the corresponding area (see graphic above). Western Europe, the U.S., Japan and India are hugely expanded, reflecting emissions much greater than would be expected based on their geographic area. Russia, China and Brazil stay the same. Taken in this light, the climate contributions of Brazil and China don t seem so out of line   they are perfectly proportionate to the countries  land masses. Canada and Australia become stick thin as their land mass is much larger than their share of the global-warming pie. Meanwhile, dividing each country s climate contribution by its population paints a different picture. Amongst the 20 largest total emitters, the top seven per capita positions are occupied by developed countries, with Canada falling in third place behind the U.K. and the U.S. In this ranking, China and India drop to the bottom of the list. Matthews s study highlights how much individual countries have contributed to the climate problem, as well as the huge disparity between rich and poor with respect to per-person contributions to global warming. Acknowledging these disparities, and then moving to correct them, may be a fundamental requirement for success in efforts to decrease global greenhouse-gas emissions. * Parts of this text appear courtesy of New Scientist magazine.

This op-ed was recently published in the Montreal Gazette . Reading the Leap Manifesto was a startling and inspiring experience. Launched on September 15 by Naomi Klein and an impressive list of signatories , the Leap presents a remarkable vision of change that is both necessary and possible to achieve. In a political climate where climate change has been all but forgotten, reading such a clear and compelling call to abandon fossil fuel energy sources within the next few decades was like waking from a bad dream. I have worked as a climate scientist and researcher for more than a decade. I and others have shown how each emission of carbon dioxide leads to a discrete and essentially irreversible increase in world temperatures. We have shown that a zero-carbon emissions target is the only one that will stabilize global temperatures, and that the world therefore has a finite carbon budget that we must not exceed if we want to stabilize at an increase of 2 C or any other level. We have calculated how small this carbon budget actually is   something like three decades  worth of current emissions   and shown just how far the current national emissions pledges are from meeting the 2 C target. And I have worked with friends and colleagues to show how current investments in fossil fuel infrastructure commit us to decades of continued emissions and climate warming. I understand just how difficult it will be to limit emissions to a level that will prevent dangerous climate changes. I understand also that another degree of global warming will not be pleasant for much of the world, and will very likely be dangerous for the rest. Here in Canada, we could lose the ability to play hockey outdoors in the winter; but this pales in comparison to the potential for widespread loss of coral reefs, or sea-level rise that threatens low-lying island countries. A 2 C world will be a different and more dangerous one. But a 3 C world will be much more dangerous, and a 4 C world possibly catastrophic. So fossil fuels will not be the energy source of this future world. There is really no other alternative. This is why the vision of the Leap Manifesto is so compelling. The call for a dramatic and rapid transition to an economy fuelled by renewable energy is exactly what is necessary, and what is consistent with the science of global warming. But the Leap Manifesto is also a clear statement that it is possible to define a better world. And this is where its real power lies. For too long now, the demands of limiting global warming to 2 C have been seen as too high, too hard and too expensive. As a country and as an international community, we have stopped believing that we can meet the challenge of climate change. Why have we lost this belief? For more than two decades, the need to act to stop driving global temperatures upwards has been clear and supported by solid scientific evidence. But for every scientific step forward, there has been an onslaught of denial telling us to doubt both the reality and the severity of global warming. It is no surprise that we would come to doubt also our ability to rise to the climate challenge. Humanity is capable of pulling off dramatic and rapid change. Tipping points are possible and once crossed can take us quickly to new ways of living that do not depend on carbon-intensive energy. We can build a new and more just global society in time to avoid the most dangerous outcomes. But fundamentally, we have to believe that this is possible. In short, we can Leap.

Freak snowstorms. Devastating tsunamis. Polar vortexes. The Earth s climate is undeniably becoming increasingly volatile. A number of professors and students from Concordia s four academic faculties are examining the effects of climate change and looking for ways to sustain human activities without depleting the Earth s resources. Their research and teaching are serving as scientific warnings, opening up exciting new opportunities revolving around sustainability and deepening human understanding and awareness. We present a few of their efforts. Skating on thin ice Damon Matthews is an associate professor in Concordia s department of geography, planning and environment. He says it s not too late to stop the rise of the earth s temperature   and the decline of outdoor ice hockey   but it would require  prompt and significant action.  When Damon Matthews co-published a 2012 paper warning that the days of Canada s outdoor skating rinks could be numbered, the associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment received more media atten tion than he ever had before. Hockey in Canada is, after all, sacred.  Based on the conditions needed to create outdoor rinks and what we ve observed from the meteorological data over the previous 30 years, we extrapolated that we have about three more decades of viable outdoor skating,  Matthews says.  That really touched a cultural nerve among Canadians that I hope will help lead to significant action in terms of reducing carbon emissions.  Matthews uses mathematical calcula tions to model climate response to carbon dioxide (CO2) and other emissions.  The ratio is a 1.5-degree-Celsius-higher global temperature for every trillion tonnes of carbon emitted into our atmosphere,  he explains.  And while it took us 200 years to emit a half-trillion tonnes, it will take us only 50 years to emit another half-tril lion at current levels.  With carbon emissions still increasing, that additional 500 billion tonnes might occur even sooner, he adds. The only way to stop the planet from warming further is to stop emissions im mediately.  Of course, zero emissions are unlikely to happen overnight because people won t decommission current production and transportation systems or change their habits that quickly,  Matthews says. Matthews and his Concordia colleagues have therefore looked at the amount of emissions already embedded into the cur rent fossil fuel infrastructure to determine the amount of  wiggle room  to stabilize the increase in the Earth s overall temper ature to only 2 degrees Celsius.  If we want global warming to stay below 2 degrees Celsius, we need to cut all emissions by at least half,  he says. Given this reality, some researchers are proposing to remove CO2 from the atmosphere to keep global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.  That s when people start talking about geo-engineering projects, such as artificial trees to suck CO2 from the atmosphere,  Matthews says. He s conducting simulations to de termine how the climate might respond to some of the proposed technological solutions.  For instance, one idea is to spray reflective particles into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight,  Matthews says.  However, that would introduce a whole other suite of potential side effects on the climate system, such as impacts on the ozone layer and changes in rainfall patterns.  His modelling indicates that reaching zero emissions as soon as possible through renewable energy sources and significant changes in our lifestyle and habitat remains the best solution. To show what needs to be done, one of his recent projects involved calculating the historical emissions produced by nations and how each country s emissions are contributing to the global tempera ture increase.  Of course, the United States produces the most emissions, and Canada ranked 10th, which is not very good given its relatively small popula tion,  he says.  We re hoping this kind of information will spur governments to action.  There s a misconception that even if we stopped emitting carbon, the Earth s temperature would continue to rise, and that s not the case,  he emphasizes.  We could stabilize the planet s temperature if we take prompt and significant ac tion.  It s why Matthews conducts studies that alert people to the fact that if carbon emissions aren t dramatically curbed without delay, other young boys and girls might not have the chance to learn hockey on an outdoor rink like Wayne Gretzky did. If carbon emissions aren t dramatically curbed without delay, other young boys and girls might not have the chance to learn hockey on an outdoor rink like Wayne Gretzky did, Raising awareness through art Ricardo Dal Farra, an associate professor in the Department of Music, has worked on several balance-unbalance conferences. balance-unbalance merges art and issues of sustainability. Research in the fine arts has a less obvious connection to sustainability than that of other disciplines   but Ricardo Dal Farra, an associate professor in the Department of Music, is helping change that perception. Dal Farra has been a leading organizer of three international BALANCE-UNBALANCE conferences that have brought artists together with scientists, engineers, sociologists, policymakers and others to help resolve the world s pressing environmental issues. BALANCE-UNBALANCE 2011 involved the collaboration of colleagues from Concordia s departments of Geography, Planning and Environment, Political Science, Design and Computation Arts, Communication Studies and Music, as well as the David O Brien Centre for Sustainable Enterprise. The highly successful 2013 BALANCE-UNBALANCE conference was held at the UNESCO-designated Noosa Biosphere in Queensland, Australia. It prompted the Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre to approach Dal Farra about creating some original music to play during their presentations and workshops, as well as games that the organization uses to help government officials and other key people to understand the complexities of disaster risk management. Dal Farra suggested a contest to find original music and sound-art works for the climate centre s overall humanitarian responses to people dealing with floods, drought and other disasters related to climate change.  Pablo Suarez, the centre s associate director for Research and Innovation, was so pleased that he asked if we could also launch a contest for music miniatures specifically for the efforts to obtain mosquito nets to prevent dengue fever,  Dal Farra says. The contests have been a springboard for the  art!   climate  project, which aims to use art as a catalyst for social awareness and change.  To compose a piece about climate change or dengue fever, you really have to understand what the problem is, so the contest rules prompted entrants to read white papers and other documents about climate change and its consequences,  Dal Farra says.  The contests encouraged sound artists to reflect significantly on the situation and what kind of message they wanted to get across.  A jury of highly regarded composers and media artists chose 39 submissions as being of very good quality from among the large number received. The climate centre selected nine compositions for its purposes. Dal Farra and the other contest organizers are programming many of the remaining high-quality pieces into conferences and festivals related to climate change around the world.  We re also in the process of putting all the pieces on a website  with a Creative Commons licence that gives organizations and individuals the permission to download and use them in connection with any initiatives specifically related to dealing with climate change,  he says. The response and outcome of the initial contests were so successful that the  art!   climate  project and BALANCE-UNBALANCE conference series were featured in the April 2013 issue of Leonardo   Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology.  We really have shown how art can play a fundamental role in social change,  Dal Farra says.  It s a message that I keep emphasizing to my students by integrating issues related to climate change in my teaching and making them a part of the curriculum activities for my composition of electroacoustic music classes.   We really have shown how art can play a fundamental role in social change,  Dal Farra says. Creating new value from old goods Department of Marketing associate professor Zeynep Arsel s research includes looking at  upcycling,  the process of taking someone else s trash and turning it into something of value. A lamp from the 1980s may be nothing but junk to a lot of us. Yet some people would love to get their hands on one. It s this kind of unprecedented value for items that Zeynep Arsel, an associate professor in the Department of Marketing at the John Molson School of Business (JMSB), is researching as a consumption scholar. She s looking at how people s evolving ideas of what holds value might help to save the planet s resources.  I am increasingly seeing people desire items in ways that were unimaginable in the past,  Arsel says.  And I m examining how that desire could help to avoid resource depletion in the long run.  Arsel s research is focused on how people are creating value by trading items that wouldn t otherwise be marketable.  This includes exchanging unsellable items, such as used makeup,  she notes. Her current project involves examining various forms of exchange within Canada and the United States that exist outside the formal marketplace, such as bartering.  I m investigating how people are creating and maintaining systems that I would say make up for the limitations of the formal marketplace,  she explains. She is also looking at upcycling   the process of using what would otherwise become trash to create new items, such as leather bags from worn jackets.  People are really starting to recognize the dormant value of the items in their closets and cupboards and putting that into action,  she says.  I m researching this in terms of the concept of value which I think needs to be re-theorized in light of these relatively new activities.  The growing popularity of the Freecycle Network , which claims nearly eight million participants around the world, provides another example. The site helps individuals to pass along and receive items for free.  People are using the site to give things away because they realize the value in creating more space for themselves, or they want to increase their moral capital by helping others in the process of facilitating the reuse of items rather than just discarding them,  Arsel says.  I think there may be a real con sciousness-awakening here.  Arsel is noticing that as some are becoming more aware of the dormant value in used and upcycled items, they are creating formal marketplaces for them. Entrepreneurs are establishing upcycling businesses. Organizations are opening thrift shops to raise money for medical research or charitable efforts. For now, Arsel is focusing on value that isn t determined by a monetary amount.  I m more interested in floating value,  she says.  What is it that makes  people decide that a used object is worth something? What is it that makes some of us seek out items that others consider junk or garbage? What determines a fair exchange? How is it that a book could end up being a fair trade for a chair?  Arsel has received a wide array of answers so far, which is making it a real challenge to establish some kind of shared criteria.  It s very subjective,  she emphasizes.  What s interesting is that people are not just exchanging physical items in many cases, but objects that come with stories that form part of their value structure.  As more networks for bartering or swapping become established, Arsel suspects that society s mainstream notions of value might also keep shifting. She speculates:  Fixed currencies might become less important in determining exchanges.  Arsel s research is focused on how people are creating value by trading items that wouldn t otherwise be marketable.  This includes exchanging unsellable items, such as used makeup,  she notes.

Whether you re waiting for a bus that seems like it will never show up, or experiencing a sudden power outage on the subway, you are not alone: public transit woes are common around the world.   New research from Concordia uses mobile technology to map routes, calculate travel times and help alleviate some of the most pesky transport issues. Getting around in the developing world While transportation troubles might seem particularly painful in Western urban centres, they can be even more keenly felt in the developing world. That s why one of Zachary Patterson  s former students   now with the Agence fran aise de d veloppement  contacted him to map the public transit system in Ghana s capital, Accra. Patterson, an associate professor in the Department Geography, Planning and Environment , hopes the results of his project will help Western municipalities see how they can learn from these experiences in Africa.  Cities in the developing world face a common challenge when trying to better organize their transportation systems: they don t have accurate information about the transportation network that already exists,  says Patterson, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Transportation and Land Use Linkages for Regional Sustainability.  Because data collection is a complicated and costly exercise, city officials don t have the resources to thoroughly review their network,  he says.  That s why using inexpensive, readily available mobile technology is such a valuable tool.  The trouble with trotros At the heart of Accra s transit system is a fleet of small public transit buses known as trotros. The Accra Municipal Assembly has been working with AFD for a number of years to better regulate the trotro system. Initial regulatory steps identified and licensed routes, but the number of routes in operation and their actual itineraries, remained unknown. That s where Patterson, a former transportation planner with Agence m tropolitaine de transport in Montreal , came in. Accra s Department of Transport (DoT) and the Agence fran aise de d veloppement undertook a survey of the city s trotro routes armed with GPS-enabled smart phones to map the city s transit network with a very limited budget, and a short time frame. Using two mobile apps, DataMobile , which Patterson had initially developed at Concordia to map transportation habits in Montreal, and Tap Log , surveyors rode the trotros while recording GPS points and logging stops along the routes. The recorded data was then processed and analyzed by Patterson s research team back in Montreal. Ghost routes The results were surprising for both Patterson and Accra s city planners. They found that the transit network was full of  ghost routes    pathways that had been claimed by drivers but that weren t in use.  Drivers would preventatively register routes that they thought would one day be profitable in order to have a monopoly on them,  Patterson says.  Registering a route gives a driver the exclusive right to operate it, so that they can make sure that no competing driver can scoop them in the future.  These ghost routes were an important discovery for the DoT, as it provided a clearer sense of the actual extent of trotro services   315 active routes instead of the originally claimed 580. What s best for the West? The AccraMobile project was recently presented at the 95th annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board in the United States.

The lead facilitator is Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment .  The spirit of this project is that these two spaces, which will be collectively designed by the community, students and myself, represent the union between two culturally and historically different neighbourhoods as well as the dialogue between the past and the future of Montreal,  he says.  The outcome could be, for example, a monument, a plaza or an art installation. They ll be built and inaugurated in mid 2017 in the context of Montreal s anniversary.  User-driven design exercise Organizers are calling this weekend s outreach event a  design charrette,  consisting of two day-long sessions, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., on site at the parks  chalets.  A charrette is an intensive participatory design exercise in which professionals, scholars and/or students facilitate the visioning and conceptualization of an urban space/project through a dialogue with the community,  says De la Llata.  This methodology, which we call  planning-in-situ , involves conversations, presentations, walking tours, video-photographic analysis and sketching. We plan the space from within the space itself.  The designated parks for the project are Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Park, on the corner of Girouard Ave. and Sherbrooke Street West, and Kent Park, at the corner of Chemin de la C tes-des-Neiges and Kent. The first charrette is on Saturday, March 12, at Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Park, and the second charrette is on Sunday March 13 at Kent Park. Breakfast, lunch and coffee will be provided.

Concordia set this year s theme, Climate (of) Change: Cities, People and Prosperity , and staff and faculty from the Office of Research developed the programming. The conference will include a scientific overview of the history of climate change by  Damon Matthews , associate professor in the  Department of Geography, Planning and Environment  and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability. Matthews  runs the  Concordia Climate Science, Impacts and Mitigation Studies (C2SIMS) Lab , which aims to improve our understanding of the science of climate change, its impacts on human and environmental systems, and address how best to mitigate human disruption of the climate.  Daniel Horen Greenford One example of the kind of research underway in the lab is Daniel Horen Greenford s ongoing Master s thesis project, in which he s attempting to calculate national contributions to climate change using his own formalizations of emissions accounting. If real change is to occur, says Horen Greenford, leaders and experts need to learn from the mistakes of past global initiatives. Horen Greenford uses the example of the Kyoto Protocol as a climate policy that hurt more than it helped. It allowed manufacturing to be displaced to non-signatory countries whose factories pollute more per unit than those in the developed nations where production originated. The phenomenon is known as  carbon leakage,  and it has caused a net increase in global emissions. At the same time, developed nations are able to congratulate themselves on meeting their reduction targets.   This standard has allowed wealthy nations to dislocate their emissions in order to meet their reduction targets while global emissions still rise,  Horen explains.  It s like a high school bully forcing another kid to hide contraband when the teacher checks his bag.  A different way of tracking emissions To tackle this issue, Horen Greenford is developing a new accounting method that effectively captures the effects of trade and allocates emissions embodied in goods to trading partners in a fair way. The model weighs emissions according to their economic benefit, using a definition of utility rooted in ethical considerations of necessity, while respecting geographical circumstances and cultural plurality. The production of goods is weighted in accordance with their utility. Essential items have the highest levels of utility while luxury items have the lowest. Weighting penalizes nations less for consuming goods that are more useful and holds populations more responsible for items they consume that are not necessary for survival. For example, a region that has a lot of cars should assume responsibility for the emissions used in the production of their vehicles in other countries, especially when producing regions do not have high car-ownership rates.  We must provide an account of emissions that better captures responsibility for emissions and can be used to hold nations accountable accordingly in international policy agreements,  says Horen Greenford.  This boils down to how we tabulate national inventories. By including emissions embodied in traded goods into national inventories, a better case can be made for bringing more countries to the negotiating table   one that is more robust and has greater considerations of equity.  Facing climate change in our city This model could also be used at the municipal level, too, says Horen Greenford. An urban inventory of all goods and services imported and exported could be traced across the supply chain to give cities a sense of their global impact on greenhouse gas emissions.  Here in Montreal, figuring out how we are impacting climate change would help policy and inform businesses and governments to make better choices when it comes to urban planning and infrastructure investment.

This op-ed was  recently published in the Montreal Gazette . With the adoption of the Paris Agreement , the world has finally struck a deal to fight climate change. The goal  to hold temperatures to  well below 2  C  and pursue  efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5  C   is impressively ambitious. If we can achieve this, we stand a good chance of avoiding some truly dangerous climate impacts. On the other hand, the Paris Agreement does not include mechanisms to compel countries to act, and countries  current emissions commitments will not be enough to achieve the agreement s temperature goal. The success or failure of the Paris Agreement will therefore depend entirely on the collective actions of all nations in the years to come. And achieving the 2 C target let alone 1.5 C  will require strong action on every front. The Paris Agreement states that countries should seek to  reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible   and to undertake rapid reductions   so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century.  This is unfortunately not the clearest of statements. So here is what it actually means: To stabilize global temperatures at any level, we need to stop adding carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Net emissions from human activity must eventually reach zero, such that any continued emissions are balanced by an equivalent amount of intentional removal from the atmosphere. To meet the 2 C goal, this net-zero target must be reached by the year 2070. To stay below 1.5 C, we have to hit net-zero by closer to 2050. Meeting the 2 C target will be hard. Staying below 1.5 C will be even harder. Impossible? Only if we don t try hard enough. Encouragingly, there is now some evidence of progress. According to new emissions data from the Global Carbon Project published last week in Nature Climate Change, global CO2 emissions have been stable since 2013. Emissions from 2013-2014 increased by only 0.6 per cent (compared to 2.5 per cent increases in previous years), and emissions in 2015 may have actually decreased back to 2013 levels. This is the result of decreased coal use in China coupled with rapid global growth of non-fossil energy sources, and marks the first time that emissions have not increased during a time of global economic expansion. It may be that a  global peaking  of CO2 emissions has occurred sooner than we dared to imagine possible. And if nations take up the challenge of the Paris Agreement, this might even be enough to move us further along a decreasing emissions trajectory. Canada has an opportunity to step up and lead this global effort. According to researchers at Stanford University, Canada could transition to 100 per cent renewable energy sources by 2050, using a combination of wind, solar and hydro power. This is the bar we have to set for ourselves. We have both the responsibility and the ability to act to cut our emissions more quickly than the rest of the world. It is therefore essential that the target of eventual net-zero emissions be internalized at every level of decision-making. New energy infrastructure needs to be carbon-free, and existing fossil fuel energy infrastructure needs to be either decommissioned or retrofitted with carbon capture technology. New buildings should be built to be powered by renewable energy technology, and existing buildings retrofitted with new energy technologies. New vehicles should be built without internal combustion engines, and existing gasoline-powered vehicles phased out. None of this is impossible. It is just a question of making the right choices. We need to realize and acknowledge that every greenhouse gas emission that we produce takes us incrementally closer to the level of climate change we need to avoid. We need to spend our remaining carbon budget with the utmost reticence and care. The Paris Agreement tells us where we need to go, but it will be up to us to choose the path that will take us there.

And today, November 18, is Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Day ,  recognized internationally as an opportunity for GIS users to demonstrate how the technology is being used to make a difference in our society.  What better occasion to announce a new agreement between Quebec s universities and the Minist re de l nergie et des ressources naturelles (MERN) that provides unprecedented access to a wide range of geospatial data products? The agreement, negotiated by the Bureau de coop ration interuniversitaire (BCI), means that a large trove of government information  road and address networks, topographic maps, cadastral and LIDAR data, and orthophotos (geometrically corrected aerial images)  will now be readily available to researchers at the province s post-secondary institutions.  Big data has become crucial to answering large questions facing society,  says Concordia s university librarian Guylaine Beaudry, who participated in the negotiations along with geospatial and data services librarian Alex Guindon.  By increasing access to almost all geospatial data produced by the Quebec government, this agreement will make it easier to advance research and scholarship in Quebec,  says Beaudry. Geospatial data is anything that identifies geographical features and boundaries on the planet. This includes the coordinates and topology of natural structures, construction projects, oceans and more. It s often assessed, manipulated or analyzed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Guindon says the use of GIS across disciplines is booming.  So, anyone who may need to look at aerial photos, elevation data, road networks and detailed topographic maps will benefit tremendously from these newly available datasets.  Andr  Roy, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science , says the announcement is great news for students and researchers across numerous departments.  It will enhance our ability to represent, understand and solve a wide range of problems related to the environment and to our society.  Some of the newly available datasets cover the whole province of Quebec, and the resolution is superior to what was previously available from the federal government. Pascale Biron from the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment says this is important, because students who may have previously chosen to focus their research on other areas, including the United States  for which geospatial data was more readily available   will now be more likely to conduct their projects locally.  It s an opportunity for everyone to get to know their environment a bit better, and it's only positive to make sure that such data are available,  she says. Discussions with the government were a collective process, involving major contributions from colleagues from other universities. With the support of researchers, both librarians and civil servants at MERN worked together towards the common goal of improving access to geospatial data. For her part, Beaudry says she s proud of the role played by the province s university library system in supporting access to geospatial data. She adds that, for Concordia, the initiative fits in well with the new strategic directions .   By improving our local and global understandings of populations, places and communities, this new agreement contributes to the conditions that will help us double our research and teach for tomorrow.

But what does that mean locally? A new study published in Nature Climate Change pinpoints the temperature increases caused by CO 2 emissions in different regions around the world. Using simulation results from 12 global climate models, Damon Matthews , a professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment , along with post-doctoral researcher Martin Leduc, produced a map that shows how the climate changes in response to cumulative carbon emissions around the world. They found that temperature increases in most parts of the world respond linearly to cumulative emissions.  This provides a simple and powerful link between total global emissions of carbon dioxide and local climate warming,  says Matthews.  This approach can be used to show how much human emissions are to blame for local changes.  Leduc and Matthews, along with co-author Ramo n de Eli a from Ouranos , a Montreal-based consortium on regional climatology, analyzed the results of simulations in which CO2 emissions caused the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to increase by 1 per cent each year until it reached four times the levels recorded prior to the Industrial Revolution. Globally, the researchers saw an average temperature increase of 1.7  0.4 C per trillion tonnes of carbon in CO2 emissions (TtC), which is consistent with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . But the scientists went beyond these globally averaged temperature rises, to calculate climate change at a local scale. At a glance, here are the average increases per trillion tonnes of carbon that we emit, separated geographically ( view the full table here ): Western North America 2.4   0.6 C Central North America 2.3   0.4 C Eastern North America 2.4   0.5 C Alaska 3.6   1.4 C Greenland and Northern Canada 3.1   0.9 C North Asia 3.1   0.9 C Southeast Asia 1.5   0.3 C Central America 1.8   0.4 C Eastern Africa 1.9   0.4 C  As these numbers show, equatorial regions warm the slowest, while the Arctic warms the fastest. Of course, this is what we ve already seen happen   rapid changes in the Arctic are outpacing the rest of the planet,  says Matthews. There are also marked differences between land and ocean, with the temperature increase for the oceans averaging 1.4   0.3 C TtC, compared to 2.2   0.5 C for land areas.  To date, humans have emitted almost 600 billion tonnes of carbon,  says Matthews.  This means that land areas on average have already warmed by 1.3 C because of these emissions. At current emission rates, we will have emitted enough CO 2 to warm land areas by 2 C within 3 decades.

Zika virus? With GIS, you may find Mayan ruins   and more Concordia expert Angela Kross explains why the application of geographic information systems (GIS) has no limits Posted on May 12, 2016 | By: Angela Kross This ingenious use of GIS generated global excitement. | Photo by William Gadoury Earlier this week, a 15-year-old Quebecer made international headlines when it seemed he had discovered the  site of a lost Mayan city  using satellite imagery and star maps. Experts  have since raised doubts , but that doesn't detract from his innovative use of geographic information systems (GIS). Here  Angela Kross  director of Concordia's new  GIS summer certification course  explains why it's the way of the future.   Concordia's Angela Kross | Photo by David Ward 'GIS helps us understand places' The story about the ingenious teen who developed a hypothesis about the location of major Mayan sites in relation to major stars is fascinating. According to  different news sources , William Gadoury used transparent overlays of star charts and known Mayan site maps. When one major star did not match any site, he used satellite images to explore the location further. The process he used to develop and test his hypothesis involves some very typical and conventional geographic information system (GIS) tasks: the use of map overlays and satellite remote sensing. Satellite images allow us to observe and measure objects anywhere on earth, but interpretations need to be careful and validated. The satellite images in this case, for example, revealed a set of geometric structures (e.g. rectangles) under the vegetation canopy. It is hard to attribute these structures to natural phenomena. Man-made structures such as the Maya temples could cause such features in the images. But so could old abandoned agriculture fields, for example (or something else). Only a field expedition could give a true validation of this hypothesis, which could become a very difficult and expensive process. This is where GIS and remote sensing can play a very important role. For example, if the features were indeed caused by an old agriculture/corn field, satellite images of 5, 10 or 20 years ago could help explain the nature of the observed features. Spatial data and maps of communities that live around that area (if they exist) or maps of agriculture activities in that area would also help us understand whether the features could be caused by recent activities. All this information (satellite images and maps) can be displayed and analyzed using free open source or proprietary GIS software.   5 great uses of GIS The application of GIS has no limitations, as long as we have spatial information (location, location, location!). GIS can play a powerful role in assisting scientists, business specialists and community organizations validate hypotheses and communicate information and research from many domains. Biology and environmental health specialists, for example, may want to map the distribution of the Zika vector (mosquitoes) habitat worldwide. Will increasing temperatures push the boundaries of those habitats? An urban planner may want to map green spaces in the city to evaluate the need for increased green areas. A high school teacher may want to teach history classes using GIS storytelling: attaching dates to places and photos; all on Google Earth for example. An NGO may want to collect information from aboriginal communities to map the most important lands, according to them (participatory GIS). A transport company may want to know if their existing routes are actually covering the needs of the consumers. Where would new services be needed? GIS helps us to understand places, to detect and understand spatial patterns and to determine relationships between variables over time and space. GIS plays an important role in bridging multiple disciplines, and in enabling collaboration using one platform.

Farkas remembers the moment like it was yesterday:  He was looking at this taped-up poster of his concert we did at the Corona Theatre when I approached him and said,  Hi Mr. Bradley. Do you like the poster?  As vice president of Concerts and Events for Montreal concert promotion and production company evenko, Nick Farkas, BA 90, runs Montreal s Osheaga annual music festival. | Photo credit: Susan Moss  I really like it,  Bradley replied.  That was a great show.  After Farkas welcomed Bradley back to Montreal, the singer told him,  I ve been here before.   Yes, you were at Osheaga a few years ago,  Farkas said.  No, I ve been here before.  Bradley then pointed to where the Place des Nations stage used to be.  I played here in 1967.   I was speechless,  Farkas says today.  To experience that with him right there was beyond cool   it was a surreal moment, my all-time favourite Osheaga story.  Veteran Australian band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds played in 2014 at Osheaga, one of the few festivals they appeared at. | Photo credit: Susan Moss As co-founder of Osheaga , IleSoniq , Heavy Montr al and the YUL EAT festivals, Farkas has pretty much seen it all. He got his start booking shows while still a student at Concordia.  I started with a buddy of mine in the late 1980s. We were very into punk rock and the bands we wanted to see weren t coming to Montreal very often,  Farkas recalls.  So we started calling up bands and booking them. We did it just to see the bands we wanted to see. The bands would come to Montreal, they d sleep on our floor and we d do all the work,  Farkas says.  I never thought this would become an actual job, but I co-founded Greenland Productions in 1993 and did that for a few years. I had a chance to make a real living at it, and it s been nonstop ever since.  The Hamilton-born, Montreal-raised Farkas is now vice president of Concerts and Events for Montreal concert promotion and production company evenko , which presented  1,300 shows last year from Vermont to Newfoundland,  Farkas reports. The notorious Iggy Pop wowed the crowd at Osheaga in 2008. Photo credit: Susan Moss  It s a huge amount of work. With Osheaga, we have reached the point 11 years in where we have a much bigger office, a much bigger team. But it s very uniting in terms of business: we are 100 per cent in control of the creative, the production and who we book,  he says.  There are various people in the booking department of various ages   me being the oldest   and everybody fights for the bands they would like to see at the festival. It s a very long process. There are 110 acts on the bill and we want every act to be the best act possible.  Farkas recalls:  We used to sit in a room with a board with band names cut out on pieces of paper and we moved them around in the schedule to find the best order possible. Now we re a bit more savvy and do it with computers. But we still strategize the same way   we look at every slot and we really try to gap it so you can catch 10 minutes of this, and 15 minutes of that. I love the idea of people discovering new music and running from one stage to another.  Lana Del Rey is one of the headliners at the 11th edition of Osheaga, July 29 to 31, 2016.

We booked Radiohead in Montreal for the first time at the 500-capacity club Woodstock back in 1993,  says Farkas.  We were literally doing Nirvana that same night at the Verdun Auditorium and raced uptown to catch the end of Radiohead! That was how you did it back then   you played a club, then came back to play the next size up.

I was booking shows on the side and working as a bike messenger,  says Farkas.  Did I devote myself to my studies? Nope, but it was important to me and my future to get a degree,  he says.  I hate starting things and not finishing them. I got a lot out of it, learnt critical thought, and solidified my way of looking at stuff.  Farkas adds:  Today I am living a dream. I remember my father telling me as a teenager,  If you can find a job that you wake up every morning and want to go to, then you re ahead of 95 per cent of the people in the world.

How can we find solutions to the world s pressing societal and environmental problems? One way is to provide free education on international issues on a global scale. So, beginning this fall, Concordia is teaming up with the United Nations to offer its first-ever Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), designed to help global citizens answer this sort of question.   Wicked Problems, Dynamic Solutions: The Ecosystem Approach and Systems Thinking   is an interdisciplinary course open to all. Anyone who is interested will have the opportunity to learn about complex ideas such as ecological resilience, environmental governance, urban biodiversity and the impact of climate change in an accessible way.  While there are many MOOCs out there that introduce ecosystem services and related topics, this is one of the first that focuses explicitly on the ecosystem approach, long adopted as desirable by the UN, while covering so many key ecosystems and overarching themes  explains Peter Stoett , director of the Loyola Sustainability Research Centre (LSRC). A Canadian first The Education Department of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi contacted Stoett last year about the possibility of setting up a MOOC together. He immediately set about securing the support of colleagues from across the university.  This is the first time Concordia has worked with the UN on a major online educational project,  Stoett says, adding that Concordia s partnership with UNEP on a large-scale MOOC is also a first for a Canadian university. The Department of Geography, Planning and Environment (GPE) will host the course, which will feature speakers from both GPE and LSRC, including Stoett and fellow researchers in the areas of environment and sustainability,   Damon Matthews , Annie Lalancette , Katja Neves, and Pascale Biron   all of whom helped to develop various aspects of the course. Concordia experts will be joined by international colleagues from UNEP in Nairobi and elsewhere.  We are very excited about this initiative and proud to be associated with a MOOC that has been so thoughtfully and collaboratively designed and developed,\" says Monica Mulrennan , Associate Professor and Chair of GPE. Always eager to provide Concordia students with exciting options,  Stoett and FAS Dean Andr  Roy ensured that the initiative will include a course credit option  ( GEOG 298   Selected Topics in Geography ), in a blended-learning format   partly online and partly in the classroom.  This will provide a greatly enriched opportunity for students to engage with the material they ve been exposed to through the MOOC and take it further,  says Mulrennan. Facilitating international dialogue The MOOC is being produced in partnership with KnowledgeOne, the digital learning developer for all of Concordia s online courses. CEO Robert Beauchemin says there was a steep learning curve involved, referring to the technical complexity of the powerful Open edX platform adopted for the course.  We are eager to step up to the challenge of seeing this project succeed.  For those wishing to take the online-only course, registration is free and open to all. A high-school level education is recommended.  The MOOC will provide the opportunity for students and professionals from across the world to interact,  says LSRC Co-ordinator Rebecca Tittler .  Participants will also be able to apply course material from their own geographic perspectives.  For example, the course includes interactive mapping exercises which ask students to post pictures from their neighbourhood and then link them to similar pictures from elsewhere. The course will also have an active online discussion board to facilitate international dialogue about the issues being taught.  Wicked Problems, Dynamic Solutions  was designed to be open to as many people as possible.  It is all about accessibility,  says Stoett.  Thousands of individuals from various age groups and backgrounds can take the course.  Available on your mobile One other crucial element   people can follow the course on their cell phones.  This is important because in many places around the world, cell phones may be a lot more accessible than computers,  explains Tittler. Both Mulrennan and Stoett agree it will be important to pay close attention to how this initial MOOC works in practice, in case the university wants to plan for more of them in the future.  The course is considered a pilot project this fall,  says Stoett.  After that, we will revisit the entire production and teaching process and strive to improve it.  For now, with registration up and running, enthusiasm for the course is high. The university is already committed to developing another UNEP-based MOOC for 2017, and discussions are ongoing around a third option.  We are certainly teaching for tomorrow with MOOCs and blended-learning approaches,  Stoett says.  But more importantly, we are teaching the basics of an ecosystem approach that will be vital to the survival of future generations.  Learn more about the course or register.  Concordia students wishing to take the blended course can register online via the MyConcordia portal.  The course begins on Monday, September 12.

On May 2, Canadians began receiving access codes to complete the questionnaire online by May 10. So many people rushed to the Statistics Canada census page that the site went down for 45 minutes . The census collects demographic information on every person in Canada. That data is used by governments, businesses, community organizations and others to make decisions at all levels. One in four households received the 36-page long-form questionnaire. The rest of Canadians will fill out the 10-question version. Both are mandatory. Zachary Patterson , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning, Environment , studies modelling of transportation, the environment, land-use and their linkages.  We asked him about the 2016 census and what it means for our nation.   Should Canadians be excited about this census? Zachary Patterson: Yes, they should. While the 2011 census was consistent and comparable with previous censuses, the National Household Survey was not. The National Household Survey replaced the \"Long form\" of the census. The NHS and Long form of the census collect more detailed information (revenues, ethnic background, employment status, sector of employment, etc.) on households than the census that collects basic information (number of people, ages, genders, etc.). Whereas the Long form of the census (administered to one in five households) was obligatory, the National Household Survey was not. This meant that its results were not comparable with previous information from previous censuses. As a result, this census will be the first time we will have comparable data about many aspects of the lives of Canadians in 10 years. In this digital information-gathering age, is a census still necessary? Doesn't Amazon (for example) have more useful and/or personal information about us? ZP: A census acts as a statistical/socio-demographic ground truth. Without the information provided by a census (i.e. the characteristics of an entire population), it is difficult to put many other types of data in to context   i.e. establish whether they are representative and what they actually represent. If one wants to make inferences about the Canadian population at almost any geographic level (country, province, CMA, census tract) knowledge of the characteristics of the population is necessary. Suppose you wanted to know how many people in the country owned a smartphone. To do this you sampled 1,000 people from across the country. If 800 of those people had a smartphone, how could you estimate how many people in the country had them without knowing the actual population? For the time being, a census is the most practical way to collect such information. There are other alternatives that may in the future be a feasible replacement, but they are fraught with difficulties. Many companies now collect a lot of information on their clients and users. Supposing a smartphone manufacturer collected information on phone owners. First, they probably don't have all information that would typically be collected in a census   they may know (or infer) gender and possibly age, but probably wouldn't know very much about occupation, education, revenue, etc. Second, not everyone has a smartphone, and no smartphone manufacturer makes all smartphones. As a result, it would be difficult to make inferences about the entire population just from smartphone information. It may be possible someday (as is done in some Scandinavian countries) to collect most required census information from existing datasources (e.g. income tax, provincial health insurance, etc.). At the same time, these sources are not necessarily comprehensive (not everyone files taxes), it may be difficult for the federal government to get information from data sources within provincial jurisdiction (e.g. health insurance records). As with the smartphone example above, there is also the problem of missing data. If, for example, people with lower revenues file taxes less, this would provide a distorted picture of revenues. Does census information assist your research and/or teaching at Concordia? If so, then how? ZP: Absolutely. Most of my research in one way or another requires census information. Statistics Canada told the CBC that  May 10 is not a hard deadline for filling out the cenus. However, the government organization is encouraging Canadians to complete the questionnaire as soon as possible in the coming days.

This spring you can acquire basic skills, get support for a project and learn how GIS could be relevant to your profession. From May 30 to June 3, Concordia s  Department of Geography, Planning and Environment  is offering a  new summer certificate course  for people seeking to enhance their GIS credentials.  GIS is a growing domain with more and more professional opportunities that range from data collection to map-making to software development,  says Angela Kross. | Photo by David Ward GIS collect, store, manipulate and analyze all sorts of spatial and geographical data.  This program is special because it provides a great alternative for participants to achieve basic or advanced GIS skills specifically tailored to their project needs, outside of a conventional academic-credit program,  says lecturer  Angela Kross , a geospatial technologies specialist who was hired in August 2015 to direct and teach the certificate.  We use geospatial tools such as GPS and Google Maps in our daily activities,  Kross says.  GIS is also a growing domain with more and more professional opportunities that range from data collection to map-making to software development.  The program is designed to offer maximum variability to participants, with two, three and five-day modules.  It s a flexible training setting tailored both to expertise levels and project-specific subject areas,  Kross explains. The idea for the program was born when the department noticed an increased demand for GIS skills training outside of the traditional 13-week theory-intensive course currently offered. In the summer certificate course, participants will learn how to use free GIS open-source software, collect and analyze their data and turn that information into visual representations that will help them effectively communicate. Storytelling is also a curriculum component.  They will learn how to tell stories using online mapping tools,  Kross says. In addition, participants will be exposed to a range of GIS projects led by the department s faculty, as well as by others enrolled in the program.  This will certainly expand the horizons of the participants in terms of what it is possible to achieve with GIS.  Networking opportunities and one-on-one consultations with subject-area specialists who use GIS in their research will be available throughout the program. Kross believes the new program will have broad appeal.  With things like smartphones and GPS devices, GIS is becoming increasingly necessary to many people and professional areas that have not traditionally used it,  she explains. Kross says the program will also hold appeal for those who need it for their research, a work requirement or professional development. Potential participants could include biology students who want to map disease, business students who want to pursue geography-related commercial opportunities and NGO members interested in community mapping.  Any student and professional with the beginning of an idea or a project involving geographic data would certainly benefit from this course.  While the program is just getting started, Kross sees potential for growth.  I am excited about the possibilities,  says Kross.  GIS is a fast-growing area, and with this program we will be able to quickly respond to the specific research and professional development needs of the participants.    The summer Geographic Information Systems (GIS) certification program runs from May 30 to June 3. Space is limited, and participants are encouraged to  sign up now . The cost for students and non-governmental organization (NGO) members is $100 per day, and the regular cost to participants is $375 per day.

It was a celebration of collaborative design, and a chance to check out some cool new ideas for Montreal s parks. On April 28, Students and professors from Concordia and the Universit  de Montr al, and residents of the C te-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce (CDN NDG) borough gathered to mark the end of the first phase of an initiative to redesign two of its most popular green spaces. The project was conceived of as a way to build bridges between the borough s two districts, while drawing on the strengths of its universities. For part of it, 30 students from Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment were asked to re-imagine the site in front of the chalets of Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Park, on the corner of Girouard Avenue and Sherbrooke Street West, and Kent Park, on the corner of C te-des-Neiges Road and Kent Avenue.  From the beginning, we insisted that we shouldn't have a competition among the students, but instead work with them and the community in collaboration,  says Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor in the department, who was the university s lead academic on the project.  The outcome could be, for example, a monument, a plaza or an art installation,  says De la Llata.  The spaces will be completed and inaugurated in mid-2017 in the context of the city s 375th anniversary.  A user-driven design exercise The 30 Concordia students collaborated with 40 members of the public in a  design charrette,  consisting of two day-long sessions on-site at the parks  chalets.  A charrette is an intensive participatory design exercise in which professionals, scholars and/or students facilitate the visioning and conceptualization of an urban space or a project through a dialogue with the community,  De la Llata explains.  We had young people, elders, single and married people, dog owners, children, artists, and engineers. Each of them gave different inputs. Some mothers, for example, reported they would want to be able to watch their children in the playground but at the same time relax and have tea or coffee near the chalet.  Mainly, though, the design groups determined from the community members' input that they liked what was going on in the park already, De la Llata says. \"That is where the idea of the versatile/flexible platform came from   a space that is delivered to the community for them to transform, adapt and complete depending on the circumstances and needs.\" Jasmine Ali, an undergraduate student in  Urban Planning  and member of the Groupe NDG design team, says the involvement of the community was a key part of the process. \"It's their park, they go to it, they know more about it than us.\" In-situ design  A key idea behind the challenge was to plan the space from within the space itself, De la Llata says, explaining that the participants used ribbons, boxes and other items to delineate where elements of the design would be located.  This methodology, which we call  planning-in-situ,  is completely experimental   a method that democratizes urban design and planning. It involves conversations, presentations, walking tours, video-photographic analysis and sketching.\" At the end of the project, the Concordia students nominated two of their classmates, Ali and Faizan Jaffar   to receive internships worth $2,000 each. They ll work with the borough this summer to develop the park projects. \"I'm very grateful for this opportunity and looking forward to starting my internship,\" Ali says. \"As for my future plans, I'm looking towards continuing my education and doing a masters specifically in urban design.\" Jasmine Ali (pictured with borough mayor Russell Copeman) and Faizan Jaffar will receive internships worth $2,000 to develop the park projects. | Photos by Jean Beaudin for C te-des-Neiges Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Students from Universit  de Montr al s  landscape architecture department  also participated in a separate design charrette. Five teams from UdeM spent a weekend in Benny Library putting together their proposals. The first-place team was awarded a prize of $2,500, while the second-place team received $1,500.    A sense of unity and belonging   There was a lot of collegial and friendly collaboration among professors from UdeM and Concordia in the planning of the whole exercise,  De la Llata says.  We had meetings with city officials from the borough. They were very responsive to our proposals and adapted the exercise to suit the different needs of each school.  Borough mayor Russell Copeman, a Concordia alum and former associate vice-president of the university, was on hand to award prizes at the special event, held at La maison de la Culture C te-des-Neiges. The projects presented by the students from Concordia and UdeM are remarkable, said Copeman.  They fit directly into our vision for the 375th anniversary of Montreal, to support the sense of unity and belonging to all the citizens of our neighbourhoods, and to the common history of Montreal and our borough.\" For De la Llata, the experience illustrated the value of collaboration. \"It brings out the best in people,\" he says.  We're really proud of ourselves, as well as the community members of NDG and CDN, and everybody who participated in this project.   The spirit of this exercise is that these two public spaces, in which students and members of the community have collectively contributed their ideas, represent the union between two culturally and historically distinct neighbourhoods,  he adds.  It s a constructive dialogue between the past and the future of Montreal.  For more information, check out the  C te-des-Neiges Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce borough website  and Facebook page.

Concordia expert Rosemary Collard weighs in on the debate Posted on May 20, 2016 | By: Rosemary Collard Photo by AV Design (Flickr Creative Commons) Rosemary Collard is an assistant professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment at Concordia.   Would you take an arsenic pill to cure a skin problem? Squeeze into a corset so tight it could kill you over time? These popular trends of the Victorian age have thankfully fallen out of favor. Now it s time to let go of one more vestige of that bygone era: horse-drawn carriages. The City of Montreal took a step in that direction this week when Mayor Denis Coderre announced a year-long moratorium on cal ches   the horse-drawn carriages that carry people   mostly tourists   around Old Montreal. The city s 24 carriage operators will be reimbursed for the cost of their operation permits, which have been suspended. The 56 cal che horses who live and work in Montreal have been the subject of fierce debate between tourism officials, members of the public, animal advocates and the horses' owners. This debate bubbles up almost annually, every time a horse collapses in the street, or collides with a car, as was the case last month in Griffintown . Advocates of the cal che industry say that the horses are part of the city s identity, a source of employment and a draw for tourists. They point to city veterinarians who have reportedly found that the horses  health has improved since the city has taken measures to regulate the industry over the last few years. These measures include bylaws to  protect  the horses, like requirements that they not work in above-30 degree weather, and that they rest at least six hours a day. But even if these bylaws are enforced, horses can still be worked 18 hours a day in 29-degree heat. Under the law, the cal che horses are property, equivalent to the cars with which they share the busy streets. Of course, unlike cars, horses are living, social creatures. The cal che horses are better thought of as workers, but workers who receive no compensation beyond the basic provisions for their survival. They are workers who are exposed to dangerous working conditions, navigating the traffic, construction zones and exhaust of modern city streets. They are workers who, now unemployed for the year, will hopefully be sent to a refuge rather than a slaughterhouse, as cal che operators are threatening . The province of Quebec recently passed a bill that defines animals as sentient beings. This bill responds to a cultural shift underway, in which the designations of animals as property are archaic, like the cal che industry. Following this bill and the lead of other major cities like Paris and Beijing, Montreal should extend the cal che moratorium into a permanent ban, relinquishing a punishing practice that long ago went out of date.

Two Concordia researchers have revealed alarming growth patterns. Here are their solutions Posted on July 6, 2016 | By: Cl a Desjardins An example of urban sprawl around the autoroute 15 and 40 interchange. | Photos by Craig Townsend With more than half of the world s population now living in cities, urban sprawl is a growing problem   particularly in North America, where single-family homes and two-car garages are common. But it s also an increasing concern in various European countries, where living large is becoming more and more attractive. Just how fast are cities increasing in size? And are there ways for us to slow their expansion? New research from Concordia shows that there s indeed a lot more we could be doing to combat urban sprawl   and European countries are leading the way. Measuring and mapping  Before we can put a stop to urban sprawl, it s important to understand how to reliably measure it,  says Concordia geography professor Jochen Jaeger , co-author* of a recent joint European Environment Agency / Federal Office for the Environment report.  To do that, we developed a metric called Weighted Urban Proliferation   or WUP. It takes into account how much of an area is built up, the spatial dispersion of the built-up areas, and how many people live or work in a given place.  Once Jaeger and his co-authors had developed the WUP method, the research team combed through detailed data sets on 32 European countries to map out general trends and pinpoint problem areas. They found that large parts of Europe are affected by urban sprawl, with the lowest levels in Iceland and the highest in the Netherlands and Belgium. At a more granular level, sprawl is most pronounced in wide rings around city centres, along large transport corridors and along coastlines. The lowest levels of sprawl are mainly associated with mountain ranges or remote areas   hence Iceland s ranking.  This is the first report to provide a comparable measurement of urban sprawl for all EU and European Free Trade Association countries. It clearly shows that the rate of sprawl is increasing, and confirms there is an urgent need for action,  says Jaeger. On this side of the pond In North America, the situation is worse. In Montreal and Quebec City, urban sprawl is increasing at an exponential rate, according to a study co-authored by recent Concordia graduate, Naghmeh Nazarnia. Using the WUP method, she compared the two cities and found that urban sprawl has accelerated continuously since 1951, with the fastest increases taking place in the last 25 years. In Montreal, the degree of urban sprawl went up 26-fold from 1971 to 2011, while in Quebec City, it rose ninefold.  Compare these levels to a European city like Zurich, and you ll see the opposite trend. Here in Quebec, the fastest increases in sprawl have been observed in the last 25 years, whereas there the strongest acceleration was in the 1960s. This comparative analysis can help land-use planners control urban sprawl. The WUP method can also be used to establish targets and limits, and to see how effective those control measures are,  says Nazarnia.   Urban sprawl in Laval. Less sprawl, but not more high-rises The researchers caution that if we want to stop the exponential increase, we have to take action now. But the solution is not to build more high-rises. Simply put, the best solution is to use and re-use land sparingly. For Jaeger and Nazarnia, a combination of measures work best: Brownfield recycling   repurposing land previously used for industrial purposes, which has huge potential in cities with industrial pasts like Montreal. Careful population densification. Transit-oriented development through better coordination between transport ministries and cities. Stronger planning legislation. Nazarnia notes that these measures are already being undertaken in Europe.  Zurich, for example, has stronger planning legislation, much higher levels of public transportation and much lower levels of road traffic than Montreal and Quebec,  she says. In fact, some innovations are already taking place on both sides of the Atlantic to stop urban sprawl, Jaeger points out.  One great example is the Alternative Bank of Switzerland,  which will not give mortgages  to development projects that contribute strongly to an increase in urban sprawl. Another is the Canadian government s  recent move  to halt a construction project in a Montreal suburb in order to  protect chorus frogs ,  he says.  These are steps in the right direction, and hopefully a sign of things to come. We have set official limits on air pollution and water pollution. Why not set similar limits on urban sprawl?  *Partners in research: The study about urban sprawl in Europe was funded in part by the Swiss Confederation, with additional support from the European Environment Agency. Additional co-authors on the European Environment Agency / Federal Office for the Environment report are Ernest I. Hennig (recent Concordia postdoctoral fellow); Tomas Soukup and Erika Orlitova (GISAT); Christian Schwick (Die Geographen schwick+spichtig); and Felix Kienast (Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research).

During these years, over sixty women visited a private home, to plant a tree or shrub in a carefully designed arboretum. This field of trees was intended to be a living monument to women who had either fought for the right to vote in the streets of England, or who had undergone hunger strikes and force-feeding in prison. The \"Suffragettes' Wood\" (also called \"Annie's Arboretum\" after the famous working-class suffragette, Annie Kenney) is the only known example of collective feminist landscape design in England. It is, however, one of many forms of feminist spatial occupation during the same period. In 1965 the Suffragettes' Wood was destroyed to make way for a housing estate, leaving few material traces behind. Fortunately, an extensive photographic archive survived, and was made public, digitally, in 2008. It was this archive that alerted Cynthia Hammond to this powerful feminist history in Bath, and led to her research-creation work, \"The Suffragettes' Orchard.\" Her presentation will tell the story of the Suffragettes' Wood, its creation, decline, and destruction. It will also tell the story of how, starting with a small public art project, a community came together to create this city's first public monument to women. Where Room H-1267, Henry F.

This course provides an introduction to the basic set of planning tools available to the practicing planner. Planning practice is situated within the context of the Canadian constitution and the provincial Quebec planning law, the Land Use Planning and Development Act (LUPDA). The course is divided into topical areas relevant to urban and regional planning. Law and regulations in land use control are discussed, including official RCM plans (regional planning), local plans (local planning), revision of plans and interim control, local zoning bylaws, subdivision bylaws, discretionary planning tools (variance, holding zones, site plans, spot zoning and incentive zoning), and public participation and grounds for judicial review of municipal actions. The final part of the course adopts amore critical perspective on land-use regulation, exploring how it has been exploited to sustain the interests of the powerful in contemporary society. URBS 300: Neighbourhood & Community Planning.  This course examines theories, issues and techniques of community-level planning in urban and suburban environments. Particular place-based or identity based communities and their participation in planning processes are considered. Models of community change and local development are reviewed along with the policies and supportive infrastructure in cities, including Montreal. Local governance, decision-making, and public participation are considered in light of municipal and regional institutions which currently predominate in Canada s metropolitan areas. URBS 450: Urban Economic Restructuring.  The course provides a review of contemporary theories on the socio-spatial, organizational and political implications of the economic restructuring of advanced capitalist economies, supplemented with empirical case studies, with a particular focus on Western inner-cities. Particular attention will be paid to policies adopted at the municipal level to try and mitigate economic difficulties associated with economic restructuring, as well as shifts in municipal governance implicit in this wider transition. URBS 498 N: Planning Property & Neighbourhood Change.  This course provides an overview of the political and economic forces shaping neighbourhood change, supplemented with empirical case studies, with a particular focus on Western inner-cities. Particular attention will be paid to planning policies adopted at the municipal level to navigate the transition from managerial to entrepreneurial cities and how local neighbourhood changes are embedded within wider political-economic currents. Past Courses: URBS 260 - Analytical Methods in Urban Studies.  This course explores research methods and processes, especially as they relate to planning and public policy.

Most Significant Career Research Contributions Peopling of a North American City: Montreal 1840-1900 McGill-Queens Press 2011. This book is the culmination of 20 years of research on 19th century Montreal. Historical demographers have shied away from studying complex urban populations because of their size and mobility but through the lens of twelve surnames our \"miniature Montreal\" tracks over 60 years about one individual in two hundred. Their experiences allows us to identify three skeins of continuity, three patterns of choice, and in the timing of their marriages, births, deaths, and moves, three demographic regimes. Despite continual exchange and some intermarriage among French Canadians, Irish Catholics and Anglo-Protestants, each reproduced themselves in quite different ways and points to the existence of three quite distinct demographic systems and strategies, which persisted over the three or four generations, undermining  presumptions of cultural \"assimilation\" of migrants. Our findings force us to question certain other interpretations in the literature of the North American city, to make a case for the importance of family and kin in understanding social change, and to assert rather vigorously the importance of \"cultural difference\" in demographic analysis. Down to 1900 there is little evidence of a sanitary or epidemiological transition in Montreal but we do see the beginnings of a fertility transition. Stability is most impressive with respect to the inequalities of voice, purchasing power, and access to real property, but upward social mobility is apparent among second and third generation French and Irish and all groups adjusted in response to rapid growth and industrial transformation. People were responding in a variety of ways to a wide range of circumstances. They were operating in contexts of intense personal mobility - geographic and social, long-distance, local, or around the corner. Even in very tight circumstances, individuals were making choices, sometimes conscious, sometimes intuitive, and we argue that their experiences with moving sharpened their awareness of the space for maneuver, and promoted a calculus of choice and agency. Mortality in late nineteenth-century Montreal : Geographic pathways of contagion. Population Studies 65(2) 201 pp.157-181. In the City of Montreal, 1881, the presence of three cultural communities with different profiles of economic status makes it possible to observe the way social settings affected survival over a lifetime. Regression models show culturally determined maternal factors dominant for infants, and persistent throughout childhood. For post-neonates, children aged 1 4, and adults aged 15 59 household poverty has a comparable effect. Among adults, a gender penalty differs among the three communities. Models are improved when differentiated by cause of death. Locating households using a GIS reveals high levels of residential segregation by ethnicity and income, spatial correlation of environmental hazards, and constraints on exit from zones of risk, which together produce neighbourhood effects as large as household effects. Attention to groups excluded (foundlings and inmates of institutions) confirms that models limited to full household-level information significantly underestimate the impacts of poverty and exclusion. \"Dimensions sociales de la mortalit  infantile   Montr al au milieu       du 19e si cle\" Annales de Demographie Historique, 1988:299-325; \"A Deadly       Discrimination among Montreal Infants, 1860-1900\" Continuity and Change       16(1) 2001:95-135. These are the first and last papers from a project on infant mortality       in 19th century Montreal. This was the first scientific research on 19th       century infant mortality in Canada based on linking three birth cohorts       (1860, 1880, 1900) to deaths, census and taxrolls. About a quarter of infants       died before their first birthday, with no improvement over the period. Half       died of diarrhea in the summer, testament to the appalling sanitary conditions       in industrial cities - the \"urban penalty\". Cultural identity rather than       class or habitat was key to differences in mortality levels in the city.       The impact of filth was mediated by cultural behaviour (short birth intervals,       premature weaning and early artificial supplementation). Ultimately, we       argue that municipal government, founded upon the fiscal privileges and       liabilities of property owners, and interactions of cultural and social \"difference\" exerted a lethal discrimination among infants. \"The Problem of Out-Migration from Atlantic Canada, 1871-1921: A New       Look.\" The Acadiensis Reader: Volume Two: Canada Since Confederation. Fredericton:       Acadiensis Press. This paper first appeared as the lead article in Acadiensis in 1985. Since       then it has been reprinted in the 2nd (1988) and 3rd (1999) editions of       the Acadiensis Reader on Post Confederation Canada. It contains the first       estimates of net out-migration, by age and sex, county by county and argues       theoretically and empirically why outmigration may have been the cause rather       than the consequence of economic decline in the Maritimes. It highlights       the role of women in 19th and early 20th century migration. I was asked       to extend this analysis to the whole of Eastern Canada for Vol 2. Historical       Atlas of Canada (1993), the plate was reproduced in the Concise version       of the Atlas in 1998. I was approached to write an overview on the Exodus       for all of Canada for the CD-ROM Post Confederation History Reader (2001). \"The Challenge of the Irish Catholic Community in Nineteenth-century       Montreal.\" Social History 35(70) 333-64. This paper has been (2006) reprinted       in People, Places and Times: Canadian Social History Reader. Vol.1: Pre-Confederation. Using high quality parish records, micro-census data and city taxrolls,       combined with secondary sources we trace the destinies of Irish Catholics       who settled in the 1840s. We argue that Montreal offered an exceptional       context of a Catholic majority, a bilingual labour market and in the 1840s       a polity undergoing reconstruction, which provided them unique opportunities       for separate identity formation and social and economic advancement. We       demonstrate that the \"famine immigrants\" advanced from labourers into new       economic niches, their infants thrived, they achieved in the second and       third generations substantial improvement in housing and residential integration,       and an active political voice. These findings contradict earlier assumptions       of poverty, powerlessness and exclusion and raise new questions about urban       opportunities and social pathways. \"The Religious Claim on Babies in nineteenth century Montreal\" in R.       Derosas and F. van Poppel (eds) Religion and the decline of fertility in       the Western World. (Springer, 2006) pages 207-234. This is the first attempt to calculate standard fertility measures for       19th century Canada by matching births from parish registers to their mothers       in the census. It uses the newly available \"100%\" data for 1881. We argue       that we must extend our interpretation of fertility in the \"demographic       transition\" to embrace all behaviors that affect rates of reproduction (marriage       or starting behaviour as well as marital fertility or spacing and stopping       behaviour). Marriage was a prime demographic regulator differing more profoundly       among cultural and economic groups than marital fertility. From a set of       logistic regressions we demonstrate the impact of economic and cultural       variables on entering into marriage and on having a baby. Age and proportions       married were strongly influenced by country of origin - Ireland, England,       Scotland, France - and economic success and aspirations exerted a strong       impact on marrying and some impact on having a next child. We discuss the       ways religious differences may have contributed to the persistence of distinct       demographic regimes and the stubborn coexistence in a single city of distinct       understandings of family, distinct expectations of married life, and distinct       aspirations of being grown-up.

He received his BA (Honours Anthropology) from McGill University in Montreal, his Master's (Economics) from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver and PhD (Geography) from McGill. He was also a postdoctoral researcher at the Ecole polytechnique f d rale de Lausanne in Switzerland in the Transport and Mobility Laboratory ( TRANSP-OR ). Professionally he worked as an economist at the NAFTA Commission for Environmental Cooperation and as transportation modeler at the Montreal regional public transportation planner, l'Agence m tropolitaine de transport. Zachary's research focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment, land-use and their linkages. He is currently a member of the Transportation Research Board's Land Development Committee (ADD30), and of the Interuniversity Research Centre on Enterprise Networks, Logistics and Transportation ( CIRRELT ). Teaching activities Advanced Quantitative Methods (Fall 2015) Over the course of the semester, students will become familiar with the R programming environment at least for the conducting of statistical analysis, and hopefully also for data manipulation and preparation. They will become familiar with the kinds of statistical analysis that is typically used in the fields of geography, planning and environmental studies. They will also work towards understanding the type of statistical analysis that is likely to be done as part of their master s thesis. Ideally, as part of the term project, the student will be able to work with the same data set they expect to use in the analysis for their thesis. Alternatively, another data set that resembles the data they expect to use for their thesis will be used. It is open to graduate students. Download most recent course outline  here . Analyzing Choice (Winter 2014) Over the course of this class, students learn to design, implement and analyse the data, from a stated choice survey. The topic of the survey will have to do with an important environmental question. It is open to undergraduate and undergraduate students. Download the most recent undergraduate course outline here . Transportation GIS (Winter 2016) Download the latest course outline .    This course introduces students to the transportation    planning and modeling process aided by the use of a    GIS-based transportation decision aid tool. A real-world    case-study region and transportation system is used     to illustrate the different elements of the planning     and modeling process. The course aims to highlight     both the strengths and weaknesses (particularly with     regards to how it treats the interaction between the     transportation system and land-use) of the traditional     transportation planning approach.

TRIP Lab Welcome to the lab The Transportation Research  for Integrated Planning (TRIP) Lab was founded in October 2011 as part of a  Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) grant associated with a Tier-II Canada  Research Chair in Transportation and Land-use Linkages for Regional Sustainability.  The TRIP lab is equipped with high-powered computers and servers for  geographical and statistical analysis and is able to house up to 10 student  researchers. It is also home to unique and expansive transportation and  land-use data for Montreal as well as other major urban regions across the  country. Analysis of this data is made possible by cutting-edge and  sophisticated software for geographical analysis, transportation modeling and  statistical analysis. Research  in the TRIP lab focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment,  land-use and their linkages. It also involves using new technologies to collect  data on where people decide to live and how they move around the city.  Recently, a smartphone application                ( DataMobile ) has been developed to  conduct origin-destination of members of the Concordia community.

Her formal education is in the geological sciences, with a B.Sc. (Hons.) from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, an M.Sc. from the University of Calgary, and a Ph.D. from Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Blacksburg, Virginia, USA). Dr. Patterson's area of research is modern environments, in particular the impact of fossil fuel combustion on the atmosphere, and specifically from the transportation sector. Areas where she has conducted research include aviation, intermodal substitution, and environmental impact assessment. She has conducted research at several airports in both Canada and France. Her work has been funded by NSERC, and contract research has been conducted for Environment Canada, the Federal Environmental Assessment Review Office (now the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency), Fondation Jacques Cartier (France), A roport de Lyon-Satolas, and the American Air Transport Association. Recently, she has been conducting research, with colleague Dr. Anthony Perl of Simon Fraser University, on the impact of oil resource limitations and fuel prices on the aviation industry. Her work has been published in a variety of journals, including the Annals of Air and Space Law, Journal of Transportation Engineering, Energy Sources, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, and World Transport Policy and Practice. She published a chapter on Aviation and the Environment in the McGraw Hill book \"Handbook of Airline Strategy\", and has twice taught a short course on the Airport Emission Inventory for the Air and Waste Management Association in the U.S.A. An ardent traveller and sportswoman, Dr. Patterson is an avid curler during the winter months, and enjoys her free days in the summer at her cottage in the Madawaska Valley in northern Ontario. She also volunteers on the committee of the NDG Dog Run Association in Montreal.

He received his PhD in City and Regional Planning from Cornell University (2014). He has taught Urban Design and Planning, Urban Sociology, Public Space Studios, History of Urbanism and Architecture, Architectural Studio and Environmental Psychology at The Autonomous University of Tamaulipas and Anahuac University in Mexico and Cornell University. He has studied contesting uses of public space, such as street vending, graffiti,public assembly and protest, as urban design/planning agents. His dissertation explores alternative planning processes in the context of protest encampments in horizontal social movements. He did research and participated in the Indignados mobilizations in Barcelona,Occupy Wall Street and other social movements in2011 and 2012.  Teaching activities URBS 333 - URBAN LABORATORY (Fall 2015 and Winter 2016) This course focuses on exploring urban planning/design strategies andtactics to  re-stitch    socially and physically   interstitial spaces thatcreate fragmentation in the urban fabric. It particularly focuses on urbaninfrastructure, such as elevated highways, multi-level vehicular intersections,(post)industrial complexes, railroads and railyards. The interruptions thatthese spaces create in the urban fabric are not only due to their physicalcondition, but also because there is a difference in the social, spatial andinstitutional scale. These spaces are often under national or provincialgovernment jurisdictions (i.e. highways and railroads) or even transnationalregulations (i.e. international corporations), and therefore are detached fromcommunity and neighborhood-level dynamics. The ultimate objective of the course is to explore the challenges andopportunities is to create city out of in interstitial spaces. To explore theseissue, this course will draw from theories that intersect community planning,urban acupuncture, landscape urbanism, infrastructure planning and public spacestudies as well as case studies around the world in which planners and urbandesigners have successfully (or unsuccessfully) dealt with these kinds ofproblems. It also draws from cultural landscape studies in order to understandthe socio-cultural divisions that are created by such urban conditions. Thecourse will focus on laboratory work on the case of the Saint Henri Quartier inMontreal, QC.  This neighborhood,delimited by Highway 720, the Lachine Canal and Atwater Avenue, has many of thecharacteristics described above, and it is an outstanding opportunity to testplanning/design and policy strategies for urban regeneration in fragmentedspaces. This formerly working-class and gentrifying neighborhood is fragmentedby postindustrial infrastructure that otherwise represented common spaces.However, its rich popular culture and history gives the neighborhood aresilience that enables for (re)appropriation and (re)signification of the space. The solutions suggested for this laboratory are not  major-surgery-like ones that require large demolitions and construction of existinginfrastructure, but rather mild interventions that can turn the socio-spatialdynamics around in the urban fabric. Interventions such as graffiti murals, artinstallations, farmer markets, community gardens, and events such as festivals,concerts or neighborhood meetings are particularly encouraged. The studentswill use community-engagement methods (i.e. participatory action research, filmprojections, charrettes, planning-in-situ, place-making) to test thesemethodologies in the selected sites.  URBS 490 - PUBLIC SPACE AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST (Winter 2016) Urban space shapes publics,and publics (re)shape urban space. Public space is the result of this dialecticrelationship. Public space is also the physical manifestation of the publicinterest, and therefore is also the manifestation of conflict. However, publicspace and the public sphere is also the realm to debate about and solve thoseconflicts. This seminar explores how the notion of the public and public spaceplays a key role in the construction of democratic societies. It broadlyexplores the socioeconomic, cultural, political and physical dimensions ofpublic space. It particularly focuses on the tensions between how space isproduced and how it is (re)appropriated and (re)produced by its citizens, withthe objective of drawing lessons to enable a more democratic, inclusive andjust city-making. Drawing form theory, history and case studies, thisseminar analyzes how public spaces are planned and how different subjectivitiesemerged from those spaces, as well as how these subjectivities transform andreinvent themselves to change the spaces they inhabit. The notions of exclusionand inclusion, gender/race/age/class equity, gentrification and privatizationof public space, problems and potential of social networks, protest and theright to the city, as well as place-making and community planning would bewidely explored. The course is divided into twoparts: 1. Typologies of public space and subjectivities   During the first part of the class, wewill analyze different types of spaces that encourage and discourage certainactivities in space and therefore create different subjectivities and ways of being-in-the-world  (e.g. plazas, parks, promenades, etc.) 2. Academic and Civic Debates on public space andthe public interest   In thesecond part of the course, we will analyze and build on the current debatesabout how to plan, manage, regulate, design, use and occupy public space (e.g.privatization of public space, gentrification, protest and occupation of publicspace, paradoxes of the social networks in public spaces, etc.) .  Publications Urban Resistance: Alternative Interpretations of Public Space (English/revised version) (2014) in Viladevall & Castrillo (2010), Espacio Publico en la Ciudad Contemporanea, Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Espa a. Abstract Drawing from a historical analysis of informal uses of urban space in Mexico, this chapter analyzes uses and interpretations of public spaces that clash with their planning and design programs. It particularly explores the notion of urban resistance, understood as alternative readings of space that contest urban regulations and spatial programs and, as practices that remain in spite of historical and cultural transformations. The chapter concludes by reinterpreting a modernist esplanade in a hospital and by providing design proposals that incorporate amenities and an informal market to an otherwise precarious space. Protest Encampments as Urban Laboratories: The 15M Barcelona Encampment: A Space of Resistance and Creativity (2014) in Progressive Planning, Planner's Network, New York, NY. Abstract The protest encampments of 2011 operated as spaces of resistance-through-creativity.Without an apparent overarching structure, the protesters engaged in different forms of interaction, encounter and organization. The spontaneous processes used to organize the physical space of the encampments provided lessons for the democratization of planning and city-making processes. Rather than in what was done in the encampments, the true lessons are more in how things were done  through mechanics that allowed potentially anyone from within or without the movement to actively participate in its development. To explore these ideas,this article makes a brief account of the case of the Barcelona Encampment in Plaza Catalunya in the Spring of 2011. Open-ended urbanisms: Space-making processes in the protest encampment of the Indignados movement in Barcelona (2015) in URBAN DESIGN International Abstract This paper studies the spontaneous and organic processes involved in the physical planning of protest encampments. Drawing from ethnographic work in the context of the Indignados Movement in Barcelona,it analyzes the spatial evolution and transformation of the Plaza Catalunya encampment in 2011. The encampments evolved in parallel to the conversations and questions that originated them online and offline. Thus, it particularly examines the notions of open planning (i.e. open-source and open-ended decision-making processes) and urban laboratories that the fieldwork indicates were tested in the space of the encampment. The objective is to understand how urban space can be planned through non-hierarchical space-making processes and without a homogeneous overarching structure. This paper situates in a larger discussion about alternative space-making processes such as insurgent, tactical planning,as well as in the recent conversations about open-source cities.

Road effects model for predicting when animal populations are at risk from roads: an interactive model of road avoidance behaviour - Click here to start the model - Roads and traffic affect animal populations detrimentally in four ways: they decrease habitat amount and quality, enhance mortality due to collisions with vehicles, prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and subdivide animal populations into smaller and more vulnerable fractions. Roads will affect persistence of animal populations differently depending on (1) road avoidance behavior of the animals (i.e., noise avoidance, road surface avoidance, and car avoidance); (2) population sensitivity to the four road effects; (3) road size; and (4) traffic volume. We have created a model based on these population and road characteristics to study the questions: (1) what types of road avoidance behaviors make populations more vulnerable to roads?; (2) what types of roads have the greatest impact on population persistence?; and (3) how much does the impact of roads vary with the relative population sensitivity to the four road effects? Our results suggest that, in general, the most vulnerable populations are those with high noise and high road surface avoidance, and secondly, those with high noise avoidance only. Conversely, the least vulnerable populations are those with high car avoidance only, and secondly, high road surface and high car avoidance. Populations with low overall road avoidance and those with high overall road avoidance tend to respond in opposite ways when the sensitivity to the four road effects is varied. The same is true of populations with high road surface avoidance when compared to those with high car and high noise avoidance. The model further predicted that traffic volume has a larger effect than road size on the impact of roads on population persistence. One potential application of our model is to generate predictions for more structured field studies of road avoidance behavior and its influence on persistence of wildlife populations.

What are the objectives of environmental science? Dr. Martin Scheringer and I want to start a critical discussion of this question. Therefore, we investigate the kinds of research questions asked by environmental scientists. To do this, we are taking a closer look at four questions: What is the lack of knowledge to be addressed by the research? What is the purpose of the results? What are the subjects the research is dealing with? What are the methods chosen for the investigation? We propose that problem-oriented environmental science should strive to find answers to these questions that are different from those offered by  classical  natural sciences. The reason is that in the treatment of environmental problems, there is often a discrepancy between the needs of dicision makers and the results provided by scientific research (what we call the  datadilemma ). To explore how this discrepancy could be reduced, we make a distinction between knowledge-oriented and decision-oriented reduction of complexity. The challenge that today's environmental research is facing is that decision-oriented reduction of complexity should be incorporated in the selection of scientific problems. We use the guiding principle of  reflexive environmental research  and point out how it differs from the guiding principles of  classical scientific research . Its key elements are: reflection of guiding ideas external to science (e.g., sustainability); addressing explicitly the uncertainty and openness of scientific results and forecasts (including unknown unknowns); transdisciplinarity; the aim of contributing to the solution of complex and controversial real-world problems; adherence to relevant scientific standards.

Environmental geography is the branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the dynamics of climatology, hydrology, biogeography, geology and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment. Environmental geography represents a critically important set of analytical tools for assessing the impact of human presence on the environment by measuring the result of human activity on natural landforms and cycles. This program draws on courses within physical geography, including a distinctive strand of courses dealing with environmental issues, resources and management. Teaching and learning methods are diverse, ranging from lectures and tutorials through to a variety of practical work in cartography, GIS, remote sensing and statistics. Environmental geographers are familiar with how natural systems function, but they also know that humans are a dominant agent of change in nature. They realize that it is not possible to understand environmental problems without understanding the physical processes as well as the demographic, cultural, and economic processes that lead to increased resource consumption and waste. Environmental geographers fan out along a variety of academic paths, and these paths will cross, mingle, or converge with those of other disciplines. By its very nature geography is a discipline that seeks to integrate and synthesize knowledge. Therein lies its strength. The geographer s world is your world: it is the earth as the home of humans. Why study environmental geography? Environmental geography prepares students for careers in environmental planning, design, and restoration, as well as in environmental assessment and monitoring, resource management, natural areas preservation, and outdoor and environmental education. Students completing the program will develop competencies in a broad array of subjects spanning the natural and social sciences, as well as complementary analytical techniques. Environmental geographers ask a diverse set of questions such as: Can the global environment cope with anticipated population growth? What will be the extent and impact of global warming? Should we protect tropical forests and why are they being destroyed? What causes famine and why do people die from it? Should we allow Hydro Quebec to dam the rivers entering James Bay? Much of what happens in our daily lives is influenced by events beyond our  local world    events often beyond our borders and outside the control of our national governments. As the world s nations and environment become more interdependent, the need to understand how our lives are interconnected across the globe increases. With it the role of geography and employment opportunities for geographers will continue to grow. Environmental geography at Concordia You will find the department on the twelfth floor of the Hall Building (1455 de Maisonneuve West). Concordia geography is fortunate in having its own distinct quarters   few other departments can boast such good facilities, such as a computer lab., G.I.S. lab., physical sciences lab., cartography lab., reading room, and student lounges. The professors in the geography department have a wide range of research interests. You can learn more about these by turning to the section called Faculty.

Geography is a point of view, a particular way of looking at and thinking about the earth. It is the questions that geography asks about places, landscapes, and the environment that distinguish it from other subdivisions of knowledge. Geography is a broad and diverse discipline that examines interrelationships and interconnections, while stressing synthesis, a worthy goal of scholarship, given the lingering penchant for reductionism and ever finer divisions of knowledge. Geographers are familiar with how natural systems function; they know that humans are a dominant agent of change in nature; they are interested in the attitudes, values, and ideas that cultural groups attach to their surroundings; they have a heritage of thinking about plants, animals, people, and the environment as an inseparable complex; and they have long been interested in the areal association and spatial organization of both natural and anthropogenic phenomena on the earth's surface. As a result, geography is well-placed to act as a bridge between the social sciences and humanities on the one hand and the physical and biological sciences on the other. From such a central position, it is inevitable that geographers fan out along a variety of academic paths, and that these paths will cross, mingle, or converge with those of other disciplines. By its very nature geography is a discipline that seeks to integrate and synthesize knowledge. Therein lies its strength. The geographer's world is your world: it is the earth as the home of humans. Why study geography? Because we need to identify and analyze the global, regional, and local structures and processes that affect our daily lives. Because as the world becomes more interdependent, the need for the integrative geographical perspective will increase. Because trying to make sense of the world is an endlessly exciting challenge. Geographers ask a diverse set of questions such as: Can the global environment cope with anticipated population growth? What will be the extent and impact of global warming? Should we protect tropical forests and why are they being destroyed? What causes famine and why do people die from it? Why and where do people migrate or flee? Should we allow Hydro Quebec to dam the rivers entering James Bay? Much of what happens in our daily lives is influenced by events beyond our  local world    events often beyond our borders and outside the control of our national governments. As the world s nations and environment become more interdependent, the need to understand how our lives are interconnected across the globe increases. With it the role of geography and employment opportunities for geographers will continue to grow.

All Honours students must write a thesis and register for the Honours Thesis course (either GEOG 491 or URBS 491). The Honours thesis can be considered as a \"trial run\" for a graduate thesis. Applying for Honours An application for transfer into an Honours program is typically made in May, and the Honours Thesis course begins in September. Admission into Honours requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 on a 4.3 scale, no grade lower than a C, and the agreement of a full-time or affiliated assistant professor to supervise the Honours thesis research. An undergraduate advisor submits an electronic application on the applicant's behalf once the academic year is complete at the end of April, and the transfer to Honours is decided by a committee in the Faculty of Arts and Science administration. Once the transfer has been made, the student should seek academic advising for changes to their registration. Usually they will take the 6-credit Honours course, GEOG 491 or URBS 491, beginning in the fall of their final academic year. Some students are given automatic admission into an Honours program, but they must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 to enroll in GEOG 491 or URBS 491. In the second-to-last year of your program, you should start thinking about what research topic you would be interested in investigating, and which full-time or affiliated assistant professor could supervise your project. One good way to start is to look at the web pages of the faculty members in the department  (http://www.gpe.concordia.ca/research/) . You will be able to see the type of research conducted by your professors, and you will see their latest publications. Some professors have already thought of projects that they would like Honours students to investigate, so you can also ask professors if they have ideas for you. Summer Work To Get You Prepared One great way of getting to know what type of research is undertaken in the Department is to work as a research assistant during the summer. If you have a strong GPA and you are in the B.Sc. program (or if you are interested in working on a natural science project), you can apply for the Undergraduate Student Research Scholarships ( USRA ) from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). Note that the professor needs to hold a grant from NSERC in order to supervise your USRA. In addition, there is a new  pilot program at Concordia  that is the equivalent of NSERC USRA. Otherwise, you can approach your professor either in class or by e-mail and ask if he/she has research funds to hire an undergraduate student for the summer. In many cases, Honours students have used their summer work in the Department to start collecting their data for their Honours thesis. Honours Thesis Course In the Honours Thesis course, students are expected to complete original research under supervision. The scope of the project will be decided between each student and his/her supervisor. It is anticipated that students will emerge from the program with basic skills in formulating and testing hypotheses, experimental design, data analysis and presentation, critical evaluation of published work and scientific writing; all of the skills required of a good graduate student. It is not essential that the project produce positive results leading to clear, definitive conclusions. Projects may yield negative results or no clear results at all. This is the nature of scientific research. It is expected, however, that each project will address a clearly defined research question and that students will learn much about the scientific method in the process of completing the project. The mark in this course will be assigned based on the quality of the two oral presentations and the written thesis which is evaluated by the instructor of the course, the supervisor and an external reader from the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment. Thinking about graduate studies Early in your final year in the BA or BSc Honours program, you may wish to start thinking about graduate studies. There are several external scholarships available for research-based Master's programs both in social science (Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) at the federal level, and Fonds de Recherche Qu bec Soci t  Culture (FRQSC) at the provincial level) and natural science (Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) at the federal level and Fonds de Recherche Qu bec - Nature et Technologies (FRQNT) at the provincial level). These scholarships are highly competitive (minimum GPA of 3.7/4.3), but they offer a minimum level of funding of $15,000 per year. The deadline to submit your application is usually in October for a scholarship starting the following academic year.

Concordia s newest Royal Society of Canada member Damon Matthews s research on climate systems and sustainability earns him a spot in the College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists Posted on September 13, 2016 | How much time is left to avoid dangerous climate change impacts? Damon Matthews:  A fantastic opportunity.  This is the question to which Damon Matthews , Concordia University Research Chair for Climate Science and Sustainability and professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment , has dedicated himself for well over a decade. Considered a leader in his field, Matthews researches climate systems, climate change and environmental modelling. Now this work has earned him a top national honour   membership in the Royal Society of Canada s College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists . Formed in 2014 to recognize intellectual leaders and pioneers in Canada from a variety of fields, the college already boasts the membership of four Concordia researchers   Steven High , Erin Manning and Vincent Martin were included in the inaugural cohort, and Muthukumaran Packirisamy was inducted last year. Matthews is immensely honoured to represent Concordia within the college.  This is a fantastic opportunity to meet and interact with a group of really interesting young scholars and researchers,  Matthews says.  I m especially grateful to Concordia for their role in putting my nomination forward   this university has been a wonderful environment in which to build my academic career, and I would like to thank the many people here who have supported me both personally and professionally.  Through his research, Matthews has shown how each emission of carbon dioxide leads to a discrete and essentially irreversible increase in world temperatures. This work has improved understandings of the science of climate change, its impacts on human and environmental systems and how best to respond to the challenge of climate mitigation.  Recognition from a prestigious body like the Royal Society of Canada is extremely gratifying,  says Graham Carr, interim provost and vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.  The fact that Concordia faculty members continue to receive this honour is a further demonstration of the important contributions that our research makes to the betterment of Canadian society.  Concordia is also the institutional sponsor of the College, a tribute to the university's commitment to next-generation researchers.

Concordia professor  Zachary Patterson  is teaming up with the City of Montreal to launch MTLTrajet , a mobile app that will help the city learn more about how its citizens navigate from point A to point B.  I wanted to be able to undertake transportation and land-use research using emerging data sources,  says Patterson, an associate professor of geography, planning and environment in the  Faculty of Arts and Science.  However, getting ahold of this kind of data proved difficult. So, using smartphones, I developed an app to collect my own data.  DataMobile The app initially launched as  DataMobile , a 2014 pilot project. Close to 900 people downloaded the app, which prompted them to take part in a survey before it recorded their trips throughout the day using their smartphone. Developed at Concordia s  TRIP Lab , the app asked users for information such as their purpose of travel and chosen mode of transport.  Its purpose was to test how well we can use smartphones to collect travel data for transportation planning purposes,  says Patterson. The app proved popular, and was used in studies as far away as Ghana. Closer to home, it will be used in five Canadian cities   Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax   as part of this fall's  Canada Food Study . MTLTrajet The City of Montreal became interested when Patterson was a mentor at  MTL Cycle Challenge  (MCC), an initiative designed to improve cycling in the city by using data sets to create urban mobility solutions. At MCC, Patterson discussed the DataMobile project with representatives from the city's transport department and the  Montr al, Smart City  initiative.  The city is very enthusiastic about the adoption of new technologies in transport-related data collection,  says Patterson. After he was invited to give a presentation on DataMobile for city officials, they asked him to use it as the basis of MTLTrajet. In advance of its October 17 launch, the app is already generating plenty of buzz, on the streets and at City Hall.  It has been great working with the city,  says Patterson.  Converting data to information How will the results help advance Patterson s research? MTLTrajet will help Patterson and other researchers  figure out how to convert mere data to information.   It s a potentially effective tool because almost everyone carries around smartphones that know where they are, which can collect crucial transportation data,  says Patterson. He emphasizes the app s data collection is transparent.  The process is completely overt, so that respondents will know what data is being collected from them.  In the long term, Patterson s goal is to gather enough data to develop algorithms that will make it unnecessary to have any user input at all. Additional studies are already being planned by the University of Toronto, the  Institut national de recherche scientifique  s Montreal office, the  Agence m tropolitaine de transport ,  BIXI , the  STM  and the  Quebec  Ministry of Transport .  A travel survey collection effort is also being developed in Lahore, Pakistan. So, if you ve spent your summer playing Pok mon GO and are craving a new smartphone pastime while out and about, MTLTrajet may just be your new fall fix.  They both operate on smartphones and keep track of the location of the phone,  admits Patterson.  But it is different, in that it's not a game   and uses less battery, I hope!  MTLTrajet launches on October 17.

How does the public space surrounding the downtown campus define us as a university community? This is a question addressed in the eighth instalment of the Quartier Concordia series , currently exhibited in the vitrines of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV). Public Spaces and Gathering Places highlights the creation of Norman Bethune Square as a gathering point for numerous rallies, the use of Mackay Street as a concert ground and the recent development of Zone  ducation Culture on Bishop Street. Clarence Epstein, senior director of Urban and Cultural Affairs at Concordia, points out that people have come together around the university   in Stanley Cup parades, demonstrations, performances and cultural events   mostly in spaces not designed as gathering places.  Following the construction of Cabot Square in the late 19th century, very little priority was given to public space planning,  he says.  What we recognize as gathering places have appeared as a result of the way the neighbourhood has evolved. They ve been appropriated by the various people and organizations who live in and occupy these spaces.   Proactive changes  Now, the planning of new public areas is a priority for the city s administration and local stakeholders, including the university. In tandem with the new exhibition, Concordia joined with the City of Montreal s Department of Public Works to launch a visioning charrette to engage the entire community in determining the future of the alley that runs south of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) between Mackay and Bishop streets. A charrette is a participatory design program allowing professionals, scholars and students to join community stakeholders in discussing and visualizing the possibilities for an urban space.  We understand from the City of Montreal that this space is going to change,  Epstein says, noting that municipal officials have also placed a reserve on an adjacent parcel of land slated for a park at the corner of Mackay and Ste-Catherine streets.  The goal of the charrette and other initiatives like it is to inform good design decisions through collective reflection and communication.  The LB Alley charrette took place on October 21 and 22 in the LB atrium, J.A. DeS ve Cinema and in the alley itself. The public was invited to engage in  planning-in-situ,  with walks-through, video-photographic analysis and community sketches. Discussions were led by Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor of geography, planning and environment in the Faculty of Arts and Science . He says the process encourages the public to plan spaces for themselves   from the spaces, because they are the ultimate users. From Modernism to democratization De la Llata explains that in the first half of the 20th century, the dominant approach to urban planning was Modernism, in which form followed the function architects believed spaces should have, rather than the way they were actually used. Modernist planners felt they knew best how people should behave, and built cities designed to coerce citizens into using spaces as they intended them to. According to De la Llata, this resulted in a wide array of urban planning disasters.  Modernist planning transformed cities in a way that wasn t very democratic,  he says.  The motivation here is democratization. We want to understand what qualities people want to see in the space, and to give a chance to Montrealers, the Concordia community, St. Jax Church, McKibbins Irish Pub and other restaurants and businesses on the periphery of the alley to participate in the planning and design of the space.

Damon Matthews is a geography, planning and environment professor and Concordia University Research Chair (Climate Science and Sustainability) in the Faculty of Arts and Science . Following the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on November 4, Matthews co-authored* an op-ed about what it will take for Canada to uphold its commitment to combatting climate change. The Paris Agreement was ratified earlier this month and is unprecedented amongst international agreements for how quickly it has come into force. This agreement allows each country to decide how it will tackle climate change and requires, as of 2020, regular reporting on progress. Countries of the world have officially embarked on a global race to implement ambitious climate policies that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the planetary scale. This process is not unlike the Olympic Games where countries get together to compare their strengths and performance. If Canada wants to be a medalist in 2020, domestic climate policies must rapidly be adopted to accelerate the low carbon transition. In this context, Sustainable Canada Dialogues   a network of 60+ scholars from across Canada   produced a progress report on the country s climate actions over the past year. We analyzed climate decisions made in Ottawa in 2016 in relationship to the 10 policy orientations that we proposed previously in our position paper entitled Acting on Climate Change: Solutions from Canadian Scholars . Canada took two important steps forward. First, the federal government will price carbon throughout the country starting in 2018. Second, the $120 billion infrastructure investment plan explicitly highlights support for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This investment plan raises hopes that Canada can make the transition to low carbon development, but its real impact depends on identifying and funding infrastructure projects that best contribute to desired low-carbon and sustainable outcomes. Despite this progress, the decision to approve the Pacific NorthWest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is a step backward, casting doubt on the willingness of the federal government to meaningfully tackle climate change. The impact assessment indicates that this LNG project would be one of the largest point source of emissions in Canada and would increase British Columbia s emissions by 8.5 per cent. Continued development of projects with high greenhouse gas emissions will compromise progress in other sectors. It will prevent Canada from meeting its emissions reduction target for 2030, and is incompatible with Canada s stated goal to help limit global temperature increases to 1.5oC. Research indeed estimates that, to maintain global temperature increase below 2oC, half of existing gas reserves and one third of existing oil ones must remain unused. Canadian climate policy must tackle the most difficult question: how to transition away from fossil fuels? We call for federal political leadership that steadily and strategically adopts innovative low-carbon tools to drive future economic growth. This requires engaging with a broad range of stakeholders from the oil and gas industry, unions, Indigenous peoples, environmental NGOs, the clean technology sector and academia to discuss how to reorient subsidies away from the fossil fuel industry, promote transitions to low-carbon energy, while ensuring that workers from the oil and gas industry can transition their skills to other sectors. Ambitious Canadian climate leadership is necessary more than ever in North America. Only by working together and building commitment across all sectors will Canada live up to the expectations it rose by joining the High Ambition Coalition in 2015. Despite positive steps, the federal government has been unable so far to develop a coherent climate action plan largely because of its inability to address fossil fuels coherently. Read the Sustainable Canada Dialogues progress report on climate actions at the federal level, authored by Concordia s Damon Matthews and more than 60 other scholars from across the country.   *For Sustainable Canada Dialogues: Catherine Potvin, McGill University; Sally Aitken, University of British Columbia; Fran ois Anctil, Universit  Laval; Elena Bennett, McGill University; Fikret Berkes, University of Manitoba; Steven Bernstein, University of Toronto; Nathalie Bleau, Ouranos; Bryson Brown, University of Lethbridge; Sarah Burch, University of Waterloo; Jim Byrne, University of Lethbridge; Irena Creed, Western University; Ashlee Cunsolo, Memorial University; Ann Dale, Royal Roads University; Deborah de Lange, Ryerson University; Bruno Dyck, University of Manitoba; Martin  Entz, University of Manitoba; Jose Etcheverry, York University; Adam Fenech, University of Prince Edward Island; Lauchlan Fraser, Thompson Rivers University; Irene Henriques, York University; Andreas Heyland, Guelph University; George Hoberg, University of British Columbia; Meg Holden, Simon Fraser University; Matthew Hoffmann, University of Toronto; Gordon Huang, University of Regina; Aerin Jacob, University of Victoria; S bastien Jodoin, McGill University; Alison Kemper, Ryerson University; Marc Lucotte, Universit  de Qu bec   Montr al; Ralph Matthews, University of British Columbia; Damon Matthews, Concordia University; Ian Mauro, University of Winnipeg; Liat Margolis, University of Toronto; Jeffrey, McDonnell, University of Saskatchewan; James Meadowcroft, Carleton University; Christian Messier, Universit  de Qu bec en Outaouais; Martin Mkandawire, Cape Breton University; Catherine Morency, Polytechnique Montr al; Normand Mousseau, Universit  de Montr al; Ken Oakes, Cape Breton University; Sally Otto, , University of British Columbia; Pamela Palmater, Ryerson University; Taysha S.

That s what faculty members and community representatives will team up to discuss at the next Beyond Disciplines event, taking place Thursday, December 1, on Concordia s Loyola Campus. Organized by Andr  Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS), in collaboration with the Office of Community Engagement, the series examines the role of mutual learning in research. Building bridges/Going beyond the walls will pair FAS faculty members and the community representatives they work with. Chedly Belkhodja , professor and principal of the School of Community and Public Affairs, is hosting the event.  Engaging with community is at the heart of what we do at the school,  he says.  It s wonderful to see the dean has chosen this topic.  Ann-Louise Davidson , an associate professor in Education, concurs.  The research we do is not contained inside the physical walls of the university.  The post-event reception will be hosted by Loyola s Hive Caf  Co-op , which serves a free sustainable lunch for the Loyola community every weekday. Attendees will also get to check out an art project facilitated by La Ruche d'Art NDG Art Hive .  We are thrilled to be participating. It s going to be a lot of fun,  says the Hive Caf  Co-op s events coordinator Paige Hilderman. The speakers include Davidson and her colleague, assistant professor  Giuliana Cucinelli , as well as Chris Colley and Christine Truesdale of LEARN Quebec , a group that helps minorities in the province s school system. Together they will discuss maker culture in an educational context.  Going beyond the walls means engaging in discussions to see how we can build synergies through concrete activities where true collaboration can exist,  Davidson says.  We are conducting research in a living lab. We might not all be playing the same roles, but we can speak to each other.  Eva Pomeroy , a lecturer in Applied Human Sciences, will be joined by C dric Jamet, a partner from percolab . Jamet co-designed and co-facilitated the Concordia ULab Social Innovation Hub , an experiment in transformative education that was launched this fall.  There is such incredible potential in partnering with the community,  says Pomeroy.  We can continuously co-create learning that is aligned with the needs of the world outside the university in the present moment.    Also at the December 1 event,  Anna-Liisa Aunio , an adjunct professor with the Loyola College for Diversity and Sustainability, will discuss her research on food justice sustainability with Ga lle Janvier of Alternatives Montreal. Monica Mulrennan , chair of the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment, will outline her work with Northern Cree populations alongside deputy grand chief Rodney Mark .  Meanwhile, Varda Mann-Feder , also in Applied Human Sciences, will profile her partnership with C.A.R.E. Jeunesse , an organization that helps youth who are transitioning out of government care. For Mann-Feder, community collaboration has been a transformative experience.  These young people have thrived against all odds and are the embodiment of resilience. It is very humbling for me as a researcher to work alongside them.  Beyond Disciplines: Building bridges/Going beyond the walls takes place at 5 p.m. on Thursday, December 1, in Room 110.00 of the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics (GE) on Concordia s Loyola Campus (7141 Sherbrooke St. W.).

Modern liberal capitalism is exposing what has always been true: that it is shaped by the anxious memory of revolution, and thus by a consciousness of the potential, the menace   however isolated or consistently unrealized   of popular rejection of the existing order. The immanent critique of liberalism s failures, from Hegel to Keynes to Piketty, has developed in a house haunted by Robespierre. A reexamination of the Jacobin's revolutionary moment of rupture has much to teach us about the very conditions of possibility of political economy. For if political economy is the science of (the) liberal capitalist government   which it surely is   then it is the science of crisis, the knowledge of those confronting the unrelenting fact of poverty in the midst of their plenty.

Urban Planning provides courses involving field studies, planning projects and the acquisition of technical skills. The programs provide a foundation for further studies in planning or related fields and training for work in the planning, real estate, and social service fields. A transfer into BA Urban Planning (Specialization) from another program requires a cumulative GPA of at least 2.7 on a 4.3 scale. The BA Urban Planning (Honours) requires the completion of a thesis based on research carried out by the student under the supervision of a professor. Transfer into the Honours program requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 on a 4.3 scale. Exchange Agreements and Study Abroad Concordia University has a number of official exchange agreements with universities abroad. For example, the agreement with the University of Dundee in Scotland has allowed Concordia students to study there for one year while paying Qu bec tuition fees. The year of study there can be fully credited toward a year of study (30 credits) at Concordia. Study abroad should only be contemplated in the second year of a three-year program. Under a global exchange agreement covering all Qu bec universities, it is also possible to undertake a year of study in a French university and have these studies fully credited toward the Bachelor's degree at Concordia. Each case will be examined separately. French universities charge modest tuition fees but students are expected to be fully self-supporting. German universities will also accommodate visiting students but it will be necessary to pass a German language proficiency test upon arrival. Concordia International has an expanding roster of universities which can be attended by Concordia students. Visit Concordia International  for a listing of our current partner institutions. Libraries in Montreal The planning collections of the four universities in Montreal are accessible to Concordia students. Journals are sometimes carried by more than one institution but many journals are only available at one university. Undergraduate students may borrow only from Concordia University but you may consult the extensive collections at, for example, Blackader-Lauterman Library at McGill or the Biblioth que de l'am nagement at the Universit  de Montr al. Urban Studies students may also become student members of the Canadian Centre for Architecture. Membership will grant you discounts on purchases and entry to the Centre. You may also visit (and browse) their excellent bookstore. You may also arrange to consult documents in the specialized library of the CCA. McGill's bookstore also carries an interesting range of titles. One of the better bookstores carrying planning and architecture titles is Olivieri.

Here are some of the careers that recent Concordia graduates have: researcher with NAFTA Commission for Environmental Co-operation researcher at the Secretariat for the UN Convention on Biodiversity researcher for an engineering and consulting company national parks planner teacher (primary, secondary, college and university) city planner, regional planner geographic branch of Statistics Canada transportation planner Two areas are growing rapidly at the moment, creating hundreds of new jobs: Geographic Information Systems and Environmental Studies. Maps are the basic tools geographers use to present information. Computers have revolutionized mapmaking and placed geography on the forefront of research. Many employers are looking for people trained in high-tech sub-fields such as computer assisted cartography, remote sensing and GIS. Environmental problems have become the concern of government officials and citizens alike. Because of catastrophes involving toxic waste, air and water pollution, loss of biodiversity and habitat, and soil erosion, great care is now being taken to monitor the delicate balance between nature and the human use of the earth. Every major project now requires an assessment of its social and environmental impact, creating a large demand for geographers able to integrate the work of specialists in both the social and natural sciences. Most students completing the BA Specialization or Honours Urban Planning intend to work in some area of the planning field. Certain students upon graduation find employment with municipal, parapublic or private consulting agencies, generally in technical or support areas. Others continue at the Master's level at other universities; in these cases, the Specialization or Honours degree can be an additional advantage in the competition for the limited number of places in graduate schools and a sufficiently high GPA is a must. A double Major or Major-Minor combination can be useful in keeping one's options open after the Bachelor's degree or may simply offer a way of studying in several disciplines. Planners work in municipal, regional and provincial planning departments as well as for school and medical services boards, public housing agencies and municipal administration. Planning in the private sector of the economy is done by real estate development firms, consulting firms working for development companies, retailing chains, industrial or office location firms. Opportunities also exist in institutional planning at the management level. While the purposes and subject areas vary widely, similar approaches and methods are found in all of these work environments. Students who intend to work in the town planning field should take special note of the following legal restrictions: the Ordre des urbanistes du Qu bec (OUQ) will admit graduates of certain Qu bec and Canadian programmes of study, upon completion of a two-year supervised stage and an entry examination. Completion of the Bachelor's degree at Concordia cannot lead to membership in the OUQ, which confers the exclusive right in Qu bec to call oneself a \"planner\" or \"urbaniste\". Membership is rarely required by employers although it is sometimes said to be useful in setting up a consultancy. Elsewhere in Canada, the voluntary association is the Canadian Institute of Planners/Institut canadien des urbanistes and their provincial affiliates which also accredit programmes of study and admit members, although planners there are also not required to become members and may call themselves \"planners\" or \"urbanistes\" without membership. For a list of accredited planning programmes at the undergraduate and graduate level in Canada and the US, go to www.cip-icu.ca  (\"Student Zone\" and then \"University Programs\"). The CIP-ICU website also has job listings under the heading \"Employment Services\"); for US jobs one place to look is http://www.planetizen.com/jobs. It is usual in the town planning field for formally trained planners to work alongside architects and landscape architects with little professional distinction. Other planners do not have their own professional association and will be seen as technical advisors or administrators by their respective working organizations. Other graduates will be interested in policy analysis and public administration, for which a broadly based background in Urban Studies can be seen as sound preparation. For these students it would be desirable to increase the number of 300- and 400-level courses in Economics, Political Science and Geography as part of the elective load. Private corporations also employ policy analysts, for which an understanding of finance, business practice and management is an asset. Students wishing to fill technical positions in the private and public sectors involved with services provided to the public should acquire analytical skill using computer, computer mapping and geographical information systems (GIS). Technical positions in planning increasingly require knowledge of computer-assisted design and GIS. Environmental impact assessment where humans, landscapes, architectural heritage or esthetics are concerned will often be carried out by planners or allied professionals from architecture and geography. The Urban Studies courses are intended to provide the theory, the historical and legal background required for application in the field. All courses involve the development of analytical skills useful in a great number of work areas not specially mentioned above. The prospects for job placement change with economic cycles. There are niches of significantly greater demand that may not be lasting. Flexibility that comes from broad preparation is important but good analytical and communication skills are more important. Ultimately employers are most interested in the specific skills, interest and abilities you bring to their environment. Environmental science training prepares you for many types of careers with a wide variety of employers in the private, public and academic sectors such as, climatology environmental impact assessment, resource conservation, urban and regional planning, housing and community development, environmental consultant, Geographic Information Systems analyst, water scientist, teaching.

As the Sustainability Analyst at Concordia University, I am responsible for the planning, coordination, and execution of research that assess the sustainability situation of the University. Since sustainability is a multi-faceted concept including environmental, social, and economic sciences, the Master in Environmental Assessment program helped me developed new skills complementing my engineering background. Through the program I had the opportunity to work with colleagues from very different educational programs, which is a critical skill to develop in order to tackle the complexities of today s challenges. My internship at the Stockholm Environment Institute in Sweden gave me the opportunity to connect with internationally-renowned researchers and professionals related to the field of sustainability and to directly collaborate with government officials. This priceless opportunity adds solid credentials to someone s professional profile. Compared to large impersonal classrooms, the smaller workgroups of the MEnv program parallel a professional team-based working environment and incite people to share knowledge in a mutually motivating learning environment. Dominique Croteau, Sustainability Analyst, M.Env 2012 I am currently a doctoral student employed as a Research Fellow at the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin, Germany, working with the Assessments and Scientific Policy Advice working group. My PhD work focuses on various aspects related to the engagement of stakeholders in global environmental assessments such as UNEP s Global Environment Outlook series, the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and others. The approaches and methods I learned during my Master s degree in Environmental Impact Assessment at Concordia University, such as qualitative and quantitative statistical analysis, environmental economics, and geographic information systems techniques, have proven invaluable in my PhD work. In addition, my internship with the Biodiversity and Human Health Cross-Cutting Initiative at the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity gave me the expertise and the motivation necessary to succeed in my application for a PhD program working on assessment-making at the global scale. While for many, the Environmental Impact Assessment program provides an excellent stepping stone into a professional position, it may also open doors for advancing your education even further and help to expand your network and knowledge base to the global scale. Jennifer Garard, Research Fellow & PhD candidate, M.Env 2013 Concordia s Master in Environment (Environmental Impact Assessment) (M.Env) helped me to get to where I am today. I am currently a full time permanent employee at the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) as an Aboriginal consultation advisor and I am also the Administrator for the CNSC s Participant Funding Program. The knowledge base and experience that the M.Env program provided me has been invaluable to my day-to-day work. The course work was engaging, challenging and practical. The M.Env provided me with a strong basis and understanding of federal environmental laws, regulatory policy and report writing. I also learned how to manage large, complex projects and effectively analyze environmental assessment and other technical reports. The courses offered in conjunction with the M.Env were varied and provided me with a holistic education which helped effectively prepare me for a career in a dynamic federal government regulatory agency. The internship component of the M.Env was very useful in helping me jump start my career. The M.Env internship coordinator assisted me in finding a suitable internship and provided a lot of support during and after my internship. Although my internship was with a different federal department, the experience, skills and connections made through my internship experience contributed directly to me finding a permanent job with the Government of Canada. I truly enjoy my work and I would recommend the M.Env at Concordia to anyone who has an interest in an environmental assessment or environmental policy related field. Adam Levine, consultation advisor, M.Env 2013 I have been working at Terragon Environmental Technologies Inc. since the beginning of my internship in May 2013. Terragon s mission is to develop and commercialize technologies and products that offer communities and enterprises a practical and economical option for the safe generation of energy and water from their waste.  Since my internship I have become a permanent full-time employee focusing on the analysis and application of legislative and regulatory requirements against project scopes, the submission of regulatory permit and license applications as well as the coordination and support of document preparation including environmental assessments, studies and approval applications. Concordia s Master in Environment (Environmental Impact Assessment) has prepared me for working in a team environment and coordinating information from several different bodies/institutions. The program provided a solid foundation, upon which I base all of my work and research. Karolina Apland, Terragon Environmental Technologies, M.Env 2014 Cristina Romanelli, Intern We are deeply appreciative for all the intern has done for our team, at a time when we were especially under pressure to produce results.

Students who are ineligible to enter the internship, but have successfully completed all course work, may transfer to the Diploma in Environmental Assessment. Objectives The objective of the internship is to provide students with an opportunity to gain practical, hands-on experience under professional supervision in a field related to environmental assessment. Procedures and Conditions When The internship is completed at the end of the residency requirement (minimum two terms). Under exceptional circumstances, it may be completed earlier, but only with the approval of the EA Graduate Program Director. The internship may be undertaken at any time in a calendar year, and can span academic years (e.g. August-October, July-November). The duration of the internship should be a minimum of 4 months. Where Internships may be held at any of the following: Government of Canada agencies (e.g. Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, Environment Canada) Provincial agencies (e.g. Ontario Ministry of the Environment) Consulting or engineering firms (e.g. Stantec) Non-governmental agencies (e.g. Convention on Biological Diversity) There is no restriction on location. This may be paid or volunteer work. Remuneration for the work done is negotiated between the intern and employer. For the purposes of the course remuneration is not required. Who Students registered in the internship must have full-time status and be in good standing. For every intern, there must be a person at the place of the internship who is willing to supervise them. This person is known as the 'Work Supervisor.' What The work undertaken by the intern may be part of an ongoing project, where the intern works as part of a team, and is responsible for a portion of a report or an individual research project on a specific research topic. This work will contribute to a 12,000-15,000 word report written by the intern following the completion of the job placement, and an oral presentation will be scheduled in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment. In all cases, the internship must be directly relevant to environmental assessment and/or the environmental field. For more information on the internship report and timeline go to the  guidelines for internship requirements . How All students should register their readiness for an internhsip with the Internship Coordinator at the beginning of the term before they hope to go on an internship (i.e. in January for internships starting in the summer; May for internships in the fall and September for internship in the winter). Students must find their own internship, or apply to internships available through the Internship Coordinator. In either case, the student must keep the Internship Coordinator apprised of their status and progress. When the Internship Coordinator has an available internship, the procedure is as follows: Students will be emailed by the Internship Coordinator; Interested students should apply by the deadline on the posting; The student will be chosen on the merits of his/her qualifications, first by the employer. When the student has found an internship, the procedures are as follows: The student discusses the internship position with the Internship Coordinator to ensure that it is acceptable. A proposed placement outline will be submitted to the Internship Coordinator. This should contain specific information, including: (A template is provided to the student) Name and location of the company/government agency/NGO sponsoring the internship; A letter from the Work Supervisor (including contact information) agreeing to supervise the student for the work; Anticipated duration of the internship; A detailed job description, explaining what work is to be done in the course of the internship, why it is appropriate as an internship in EA, and the anticipated learning and professional development that the intern expects to gain as a result of the completion of the work. There must be mutual understanding and written agreement amongst all involved (student, EA Director, Internship Coordinator, Work Supervisor) of the work to be done, prior to commencement of the internship. This will normally be in the form of an agreement signed by all of the parties. NOTE: Although the department will actively seek internship placements from which the intern may apply for, the department does not guarantee placements. It is the responsibility of the student to seek and secure a relevant internship placement. Completion of ENVS 696 A pass/fail grade will be submitted on behalf of the student by the Graduate Program Assistant when: The work placement has been completed. The intern has submitted a Final Report on his/her internship. The intern has presented his/her Internship Final Report at the oral defense. The Work Supervisor has submitted an evaluation of the intern indicating that the student has successfully completed the internship, per the written agreement. Note: It is recognized that there can be some fluidity as the internship evolves. If the internship project(s) vary significantly from the original proposal, the EA Director and the Internship Coordinator must be informed immediately, in writing, by the student. It is expected that the Work Supervisor will also be aware, or will be made aware by the intern, of any change. A decision will then be made as to the applicability of the new work to the success of the internship.

This is carried out using ordinary least squares and simultaneous equation model regression analysis, with the area of the activity space as dependent variable. The relationship between activity space geometry and mode choice is also explored to better understand which geometries are most conducive to environmentally benign forms of travel (active and transit modes) and what development conditions enable such patterns to emerge.

Uncertainty is unavoidable in EA practice and decisions. Understanding the nature of uncertainty and its communication are thus important to ensuring the quality of EA. This paper explores, first, how the research community has addressed uncertainty in EA and, second, how the practitioner community considers and communicates uncertainty and the implications for drawing conclusions about a project s impacts and subsequent project decisions. We focus on two case studies of hydroelectric development projects in northern Canada: the Bipole III transmission right-of-way project and the Keeyask Hydroelectric Generating Project. Our results show that despite considerable attention in the academic literature to addressing and communicating uncertainty in the process and practice of EA, specifically impact prediction and mitigation, claims about impact predictions and the effectiveness of mitigation can often appear much more robust than warranted. Confidence levels when drawing conclusions are often questionably high. The EA community must respond, specifically with conceptual guidance for addressing uncertainty in EA; guidance on how best to communicate uncertainty in EA practice so as to ensure informed decision making; and theory building to better understand and explain uncertainty avoidance behavior in EA.

Since the 1950s, Chinese communist leaders identified acrobatics as a tool of propaganda. However, the extent to which acrobatics could be used to glorify the proletariat and Red Guards was disputed at the peak of the Cultural Revolution. As a result, many acrobatic troupes were closed down. Nonetheless, an agreement on reviving  traditional acrobatics  was reached after President Nixon watched an acrobatic performance in Shanghai, and in 1972 a state-run acrobatic troupe went to the United States to promote Sino-US friendship.

In the final countdown to the federal election, and in advance of the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference , the Sustainable Canada Dialogues (SCD) research project is challenging Canadians and political leaders to step up their environmental game. The initiative s goal? To begin Canada s transition to a low-carbon economy. Catherine Potvin, a forest ecologist and the 2012 winner of the Royal Society of Canada s Miroslaw Romanowski Medal for scientific work relating to environmental problems, has been spearheading the SCD research project for three years. On Thursday, October 15, Concordia s Science College will host the McGill Biology professor, who holds the Canada Research Chair on Climate Change Mitigation and Tropical Forests, as part of its public lecture series. Potvin's lecture,  Acting on Climate Change: Mobilizing Society to Find Solutions,  will summarize the results of the SCD consultations, during which the group spoke to more than 60 researchers from all ten provinces. The researchers, representing fields ranging from engineering to business to philosophy, were asked to come up with solutions that will allow Canada to begin its transition to a low-carbon economy. The group has put forward 10 key recommendations. Chief among them is a national tax on carbon.  We think this is a fundamental one, you can consider it the floor under our feet,  says Potvin. The price of carbon would be identical across all the provinces, something most political parties have been reluctant to endorse thus far in the election. SCD wants to see low-carbon electricity across Canada, a goal Potvin says can be achieved by 2035. The group is also calling for this kind of power to become Canada s major source of energy for buildings, transportation and industry. Although some might consider them lofty, Potvin says these targets are possible to reach, adding that in her cross-country presentations to unions, First Nations groups and industry representatives, the goals were met enthusiastically.  When we launched this document, many people were quite pessimistic, and thinking we would have no traction,  says Potvin.  I ended up giving interviews coast to coast   and I was always met with the same comment:  Hey, Professor. What you re suggesting makes a lot of sense. Why aren t we doing it?  On the political side, SCD is trying to draw attention to what different parties are promising in advance of the October 19 election. Damon Matthews , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability, contributed to Potvin s project to analyze political parties  climate platforms.  SCD is a very impressive effort to bring such a diverse group of academics together to envision a more sustainable Canada.  Potvin calls Canada s current carbon-reduction program a  smokescreen.   What we want is a plan to meet the target, and currently Canada does not have one   there s a target with no plan,  she says. It s something SCD hopes will change with the next government. Beyond political or scientific concerns, Potvin has a personal desire to see the project succeed.  I have a granddaughter, and two grandsons,  she says.  It s my way of doing what I can to ensure that they have a future that is worthwhile.

This op-ed was recently published in the Montreal Gazette . Reading the Leap Manifesto was a startling and inspiring experience. Launched on September 15 by Naomi Klein and an impressive list of signatories , the Leap presents a remarkable vision of change that is both necessary and possible to achieve. In a political climate where climate change has been all but forgotten, reading such a clear and compelling call to abandon fossil fuel energy sources within the next few decades was like waking from a bad dream. I have worked as a climate scientist and researcher for more than a decade. I and others have shown how each emission of carbon dioxide leads to a discrete and essentially irreversible increase in world temperatures. We have shown that a zero-carbon emissions target is the only one that will stabilize global temperatures, and that the world therefore has a finite carbon budget that we must not exceed if we want to stabilize at an increase of 2 C or any other level. We have calculated how small this carbon budget actually is   something like three decades  worth of current emissions   and shown just how far the current national emissions pledges are from meeting the 2 C target. And I have worked with friends and colleagues to show how current investments in fossil fuel infrastructure commit us to decades of continued emissions and climate warming. I understand just how difficult it will be to limit emissions to a level that will prevent dangerous climate changes. I understand also that another degree of global warming will not be pleasant for much of the world, and will very likely be dangerous for the rest. Here in Canada, we could lose the ability to play hockey outdoors in the winter; but this pales in comparison to the potential for widespread loss of coral reefs, or sea-level rise that threatens low-lying island countries. A 2 C world will be a different and more dangerous one. But a 3 C world will be much more dangerous, and a 4 C world possibly catastrophic. So fossil fuels will not be the energy source of this future world. There is really no other alternative. This is why the vision of the Leap Manifesto is so compelling. The call for a dramatic and rapid transition to an economy fuelled by renewable energy is exactly what is necessary, and what is consistent with the science of global warming. But the Leap Manifesto is also a clear statement that it is possible to define a better world. And this is where its real power lies. For too long now, the demands of limiting global warming to 2 C have been seen as too high, too hard and too expensive. As a country and as an international community, we have stopped believing that we can meet the challenge of climate change. Why have we lost this belief? For more than two decades, the need to act to stop driving global temperatures upwards has been clear and supported by solid scientific evidence. But for every scientific step forward, there has been an onslaught of denial telling us to doubt both the reality and the severity of global warming. It is no surprise that we would come to doubt also our ability to rise to the climate challenge. Humanity is capable of pulling off dramatic and rapid change. Tipping points are possible and once crossed can take us quickly to new ways of living that do not depend on carbon-intensive energy. We can build a new and more just global society in time to avoid the most dangerous outcomes. But fundamentally, we have to believe that this is possible. In short, we can Leap.

The World Science Forum has convened every two years since 2001, in an effort to bring together leading scientists, international science organizations, science advisors and political decision makers. The goal of this year s forum, held last week in Budapest, was to promote the  Enabling Power of Science  by highlighting the role and potential of science to inform solutions to current global challenges. One important set of global challenges is articulated in the  Sustainable Development Goals,  which were ratified by the United Nations in September of this year. There are 17 global goals, which cover development priorities such as decreasing world poverty and hunger, improving access to water, health services and sustainable energy, addressing gender and other inequalities, promoting environmental protection, and encouraging action on climate change. Breaking silos A common theme of the discussions and presentations in Budapest was the interconnection between these goals and their many individual targets, and the need to break silos and stimulate collaboration across disciplines to generate innovative solutions.  As a climate scientist, I came to the World Science Forum with an interest in learning about how climate change science could contribute to global sustainability and development challenges. Climate change will likely have its most serious and dangerous consequences in developing countries. These impacts will exacerbate existing challenges, and in the long term could compromise our ability to achieve many of the sustainable development goals. But the details of these interactions between changes and other sustainability targets are complex and not well understood; the ways that changing patterns of rainfall, extreme weather and high temperatures could affect poverty, inequality, food and water security, health, migration, conflict, access to energy and overall economic development remain highly uncertain, and in some cases largely unknown. There is considerable potential for silo-breaking trans-disciplinary research to shed light on these questions. Climate action and sustainable development In the opening plenary of the conference, I was therefore quite dismayed to hear the idea of climate action dismissed as being an ineffective way to address global sustainability challenges, and a low priority compared to other more urgent needs. Bjorn Lomborg, president and founder of the Copenhagen Consensus Center , argued that investments in climate action would detract from potential investments in other development challenges such as poverty alleviation or improvements in health services. The clear implication of his argument was that we need to emphasize action on development priorities by using the most cost-effective strategies currently available to us, without worrying too much about the effects of these strategies on development s climate footprint. Lomborg s argument was a clear example of thinking that did not acknowledge the interactions between climate and sustainable development, nor the potentially very severe long-term climate impacts on the most vulnerable human societies. The magnitude of the climate challenge   that we need to eliminate the global use of fossil fuels within the next half-century   requires immediate action on decarbonization in developed countries, in addition to the mobilization of a tremendous amount of financial resources to assist with the development of sustainable energy technologies in the world s poorest countries. Of course there are urgent development needs that could be met now without addressing climate change; but to use this as an argument to dismiss climate action altogether is to trade off the future to meet the needs of the present generation. This is fundamentally at odds with the very essence of sustainable development. A lack of real engagement There were other, more progressive perspectives offered by other speakers in other sessions of the conference, and the declaration produced by the conference organizers did include a clear call to action on both climate change and the sustainable development goals. But I remained struck by a lack of real engagement between the climate research community and the discussion of what is needed to meet the very real and pressing needs of low- and middle-income countries. I think there is a real need to fill this gap, and to engage more actively on questions of how climate change research can be used to motivate and inform not just action on climate change, but also the ways that we seek to address other sustainable development goals. World Science Forum 2017 At the closing ceremony in Budapest, we were addressed by Princess Sumaya bint El Hassan of the royal family of Jordan, who will be hosting the next World Science Forum in 2017. She gave a remarkable speech, one that managed to be both critical and empowering in equal measure, and I was left feeling both inspired and excited to see what new ideas and perspectives would be brought to this next meeting. But one message from her address in particular resonated with me: that the most potent threat to global sustainability is short-term thinking.  Damon Matthews is an associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability. In 2014 he received the award for Research Communicator of the Year (International) for his work in identifying the world s greatest contributors to climate change .  His research is aimed at better understanding the many possible interactions between human activities, natural ecosystems and future climate change, and contributing to the scientific knowledge base required to promote the development of sound national and international climate policy.

The challenge? Climate On November 30, the Montreal Summit on Innovation will seek to find ways to build more resilient cities Posted on November 11, 2015 |  Adding 2.5 billion to urban populations by 2050, which is the projection, means building 2,500 cities of one million people each, within 35 years.  | Photo by Christopher F (Flickr Creative Commons) How should we reinvent the city in the face of climate change? That s the question driving the fifth edition of the Montr al Summit on Innovation (SMI 2015) taking place on Monday, November 30, at the Palais des congr s de Montr al . The conference was organized by the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, while Concordia set this year s theme, Climate (of) Change: Cities, People and Prosperity, and staff and faculty from the Office of Research developed the programming. Academics, decision makers and scientists will address the anticipated repercussions of climate change, as well as review exemplary practices in the areas of risk management strategy, investment and urban planning and social innovation. Alan Shepard , Concordia s president, will provide opening remarks, and 16 experts in their respective fields will lead sessions. David Suzuki is speaking in the early evening, as part of the Bell International Leaders series. Climate change:  also a huge business opportunity  The relationship between population growth and climate is a hot conference topic.  Adding 2.5 billion to urban populations by 2050, which is the projection, means building 2,500 cities of one million people each, within 35 years,  says conference speaker Paul Shrivastava , executive director of Concordia s Future Earth and the David O'Brien Distinguished Professor of Sustainable Enterprise at Concordia's John Molson School of Business .  Climate change will impact this rapid urbanization, and urbanization will impact climate. This is both a huge threat and also a huge business opportunity.  Shrivastava stresses that building the necessary urban infrastructure to house future generations will require good trans-disciplinary scientific understanding of the challenges, and visionary business and political leadership. A fully decarbonized economy The conference will include a scientific overview of the history of climate change by Damon Matthews , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability.  Climate action has been an international priority for more than 25 years and we ve delayed far too long,  says Matthews.  It is critical that we set a course now toward a fully decarbonized economy.   The magnitude of the climate challenge is staggering. We need to be off fossil fuels within half a century, and this will require action and innovation in every sector of our society. Here in Canada, our energy-policy decisions have been at direct odds with the priorities of climate action. The time has come to align our national energy policies with this new reality.\" In response to the serious nature of environmental warnings, the conference will conclude with a presentation of examples of innovative commercial, social and technological initiatives to deal with climate change. A challenge for humanity  The battle for climate change is, and will be, a challenge for humanity,  says Damien Sil s, executive director of Quartier de l innovation.  There s no plan B. The SMI is the Canadian forum on this subject in 2015, offering a foundation for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) this year.  Sil s is impressed with the conference lineup.  We ve attracted world-renowned speakers, and we hope to sensitize politicians and the business community to the major impact of the actual climate upheaval.   Now we re moving into action  Michel Leblanc, president and chief executive officer of the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, says he s pleased to be taking part in organizing the Montreal Summit on Innovation for the second year.  In the past, efforts went into raising awareness about climate change. Now we are moving into action,  he says.  Greenhouse gas emissions targets and the investments announced in Qu bec s Green Fund will create business opportunities. The Montreal Summit on Innovation will spotlight these opportunities, along with the economic impact of climate change on Montreal and all of Quebec.  Students must register by phone, and their tickets are $85. Adult tickets are between $275 and $350. Admission to David Suzuki s talk starts at $35.

And today, November 18, is Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Day ,  recognized internationally as an opportunity for GIS users to demonstrate how the technology is being used to make a difference in our society.  What better occasion to announce a new agreement between Quebec s universities and the Minist re de l nergie et des ressources naturelles (MERN) that provides unprecedented access to a wide range of geospatial data products? The agreement, negotiated by the Bureau de coop ration interuniversitaire (BCI), means that a large trove of government information  road and address networks, topographic maps, cadastral and LIDAR data, and orthophotos (geometrically corrected aerial images)  will now be readily available to researchers at the province s post-secondary institutions.  Big data has become crucial to answering large questions facing society,  says Concordia s university librarian Guylaine Beaudry, who participated in the negotiations along with geospatial and data services librarian Alex Guindon.  By increasing access to almost all geospatial data produced by the Quebec government, this agreement will make it easier to advance research and scholarship in Quebec,  says Beaudry. Geospatial data is anything that identifies geographical features and boundaries on the planet. This includes the coordinates and topology of natural structures, construction projects, oceans and more. It s often assessed, manipulated or analyzed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Guindon says the use of GIS across disciplines is booming.  So, anyone who may need to look at aerial photos, elevation data, road networks and detailed topographic maps will benefit tremendously from these newly available datasets.  Andr  Roy, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science , says the announcement is great news for students and researchers across numerous departments.  It will enhance our ability to represent, understand and solve a wide range of problems related to the environment and to our society.  Some of the newly available datasets cover the whole province of Quebec, and the resolution is superior to what was previously available from the federal government. Pascale Biron from the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment says this is important, because students who may have previously chosen to focus their research on other areas, including the United States  for which geospatial data was more readily available   will now be more likely to conduct their projects locally.  It s an opportunity for everyone to get to know their environment a bit better, and it's only positive to make sure that such data are available,  she says. Discussions with the government were a collective process, involving major contributions from colleagues from other universities. With the support of researchers, both librarians and civil servants at MERN worked together towards the common goal of improving access to geospatial data. For her part, Beaudry says she s proud of the role played by the province s university library system in supporting access to geospatial data. She adds that, for Concordia, the initiative fits in well with the new strategic directions .   By improving our local and global understandings of populations, places and communities, this new agreement contributes to the conditions that will help us double our research and teach for tomorrow.

Reports of oil spills, pipeline and gas leaks, and nuclear power plant meltdowns appear almost mundane in their frequency. Research into these human-caused catastrophic events justifiably asks why or how they happened: what breakdowns in regulation, for example, or what human errors. But very little scholarship evaluates disaster aftermath. This is a critical gap. In the aftermath of environmental disasters the socio-ecological relations that constitute humankind and its political economies are brought into relief. During such upheaval, these relations can be challenged and re-thought or are reproduced. I am interested specifically in the reconfiguration of human-animal relations through disaster cleanup, a space-time in which wildlife management regimes are intensified through restoration and rehabilitation efforts that are funded by fines issued to guilty parties. This paper offers preliminary reflections on these regimes and a research program for investigating them. My analytic frame consists of Foucauldian ideas of biopower and pastoral power, a case study of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup in Alaska, and a driving question: what else besides oil does cleanup leave behind?

Origin-destination data on 60,000 residents living in metropolitan areas of varying size, density and population enables us to distinguish the respective roles played by local and regional variations in land use. This is carried out using ordinary least squares and simultaneous equation model regression analysis, with the area of the activity space as dependent variable. The relationship between activity space geometry and mode choice is also explored to better understand which geometries are most conducive to environmentally benign forms of travel (active and transit modes) and what development conditions enable such patterns to emerge. Finally, as tour complexity, trip dispersal and mode choice are intimately related, we use the Microcensus to explore what access modes and which types of environments lead to better chaining of environmentally benign modes in complex tours.

By also actively employing these devices in our research, we are using novel methods for understanding the  digital lives  of teens, which represent a mix of traditional analog techniques and exploratory digital methodologies. In this presentation we examine issues including how often and in what ways high school students use advanced electronic communication tools to arrange transportation, what travel needs are being met and modes used, and how social processes contextualize the use of digital tools for mobility. We conclude by reflecting on how the daily lives of these teens may serve as a harbinger of emerging intersections of mobility, communication, and place.

Ecosystems and species are adapted to certain climatic conditions. Extreme conditions of short duration and high intensity are expected to cause disproportionally strong effects. The EVENT experiments are simulating future climatic projections. Partly, we mimic extreme drought, heavy rain, modified frost cycles, partly, we monitor the longterm effects of extreme events at different levels of organization. Ecosystem responses  are surprising according to the resilience of important functions and services such as biomass, but also according to the disruptions of successional trajectories. Furthermore, we find that intra-specific diversity may be used for the design of adaptation strategies to maintain key ecosystems under future conditions.

Uncertainty is unavoidable in EA practice and decisions. Understanding the nature of uncertainty and its communication are thus important to ensuring the quality of EA. This paper explores, first, how the research community has addressed uncertainty in EA and, second, how the practitioner community considers and communicates uncertainty and the implications for drawing conclusions about a project s impacts and subsequent project decisions. We focus on two case studies of hydroelectric development projects in northern Canada: the Bipole III transmission right-of-way project and the Keeyask Hydroelectric Generating Project. Our results show that despite considerable attention in the academic literature to addressing and communicating uncertainty in the process and practice of EA, specifically impact prediction and mitigation, claims about impact predictions and the effectiveness of mitigation can often appear much more robust than warranted. Confidence levels when drawing conclusions are often questionably high. The EA community must respond, specifically with conceptual guidance for addressing uncertainty in EA; guidance on how best to communicate uncertainty in EA practice so as to ensure informed decision making; and theory building to better understand and explain uncertainty avoidance behavior in EA.

Since the 1950s, Chinese communist leaders identified acrobatics as a tool of propaganda. However, the extent to which acrobatics could be used to glorify the proletariat and Red Guards was disputed at the peak of the Cultural Revolution. As a result, many acrobatic troupes were closed down. Nonetheless, an agreement on reviving  traditional acrobatics  was reached after President Nixon watched an acrobatic performance in Shanghai, and in 1972 a state-run acrobatic troupe went to the United States to promote Sino-US friendship. Drawing on oral history interviews and archival data, this research reveals how acrobats  embodied practices, on and off, the stage constituted multiple sites and politics of cultural diplomacy at a delicate moment of the Cold War.

He is currently a member of the Transportation Research Board's Land Development Committee (ADD30), and of the Interuniversity Research Centre on Enterprise Networks, Logistics and Transportation ( CIRRELT ). Teaching activities Advanced Quantitative Methods (Fall 2015) Over the course of the semester, students will become familiar with the R programming environment at least for the conducting of statistical analysis, and hopefully also for data manipulation and preparation. They will become familiar with the kinds of statistical analysis that is typically used in the fields of geography, planning and environmental studies. They will also work towards understanding the type of statistical analysis that is likely to be done as part of their master s thesis. Ideally, as part of the term project, the student will be able to work with the same data set they expect to use in the analysis for their thesis. Alternatively, another data set that resembles the data they expect to use for their thesis will be used. It is open to graduate students. Download most recent course outline  here . Analyzing Choice (Winter 2014) Over the course of this class, students learn to design, implement and analyse the data, from a stated choice survey. The topic of the survey will have to do with an important environmental question. It is open to undergraduate and undergraduate students. Download the most recent undergraduate course outline here . Transportation GIS (Winter 2016) Download the latest course outline .    This course introduces students to the transportation    planning and modeling process aided by the use of a    GIS-based transportation decision aid tool. A real-world    case-study region and transportation system is used to illustrate the different elements of the planning     and modeling process. The course aims to highlight     both the strengths and weaknesses (particularly with     regards to how it treats the interaction between the     transportation system and land-use) of the traditional     transportation planning approach.

TRIP Lab Welcome to the lab The Transportation Research  for Integrated Planning (TRIP) Lab was founded in October 2011 as part of a  Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) grant associated with a Tier-II Canada  Research Chair in Transportation and Land-use Linkages for Regional Sustainability.  The TRIP lab is equipped with high-powered computers and servers for  geographical and statistical analysis and is able to house up to 10 student  researchers. It is also home to unique and expansive transportation and  land-use data for Montreal as well as other major urban regions across the  country. Analysis of this data is made possible by cutting-edge and  sophisticated software for geographical analysis, transportation modeling and  statistical analysis. Research  in the TRIP lab focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment,  land-use and their linkages. It also involves using new technologies to collect  data on where people decide to live and how they move around the city.  Recently, a smartphone application                ( DataMobile ) has been developed to  conduct origin-destination of members of the Concordia community.

(Hons.) from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, an M.Sc. from the University of Calgary, and a Ph.D. from Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Blacksburg, Virginia, USA). Dr. Patterson's area of research is modern environments, in particular the impact of fossil fuel combustion on the atmosphere, and specifically from the transportation sector. Areas where she has conducted research include aviation, intermodal substitution, and environmental impact assessment. She has conducted research at several airports in both Canada and France. Her work has been funded by NSERC, and contract research has been conducted for Environment Canada, the Federal Environmental Assessment Review Office (now the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency), Fondation Jacques Cartier (France), A roport de Lyon-Satolas, and the American Air Transport Association. Recently, she has been conducting research, with colleague Dr. Anthony Perl of Simon Fraser University, on the impact of oil resource limitations and fuel prices on the aviation industry. Her work has been published in a variety of journals, including the Annals of Air and Space Law, Journal of Transportation Engineering, Energy Sources, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, and World Transport Policy and Practice. She published a chapter on Aviation and the Environment in the McGraw Hill book \"Handbook of Airline Strategy\", and has twice taught a short course on the Airport Emission Inventory for the Air and Waste Management Association in the U.S.A. An ardent traveller and sportswoman, Dr. Patterson is an avid curler during the winter months, and enjoys her free days in the summer at her cottage in the Madawaska Valley in northern Ontario. She also volunteers on the committee of the NDG Dog Run Association in Montreal.

In the final countdown to the federal election, and in advance of the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference , the Sustainable Canada Dialogues (SCD) research project is challenging Canadians and political leaders to step up their environmental game. The initiative s goal? To begin Canada s transition to a low-carbon economy. Catherine Potvin, a forest ecologist and the 2012 winner of the Royal Society of Canada s Miroslaw Romanowski Medal for scientific work relating to environmental problems, has been spearheading the SCD research project for three years. On Thursday, October 15, Concordia s Science College will host the McGill Biology professor, who holds the Canada Research Chair on Climate Change Mitigation and Tropical Forests, as part of its public lecture series. Potvin's lecture,  Acting on Climate Change: Mobilizing Society to Find Solutions,  will summarize the results of the SCD consultations, during which the group spoke to more than 60 researchers from all ten provinces. The researchers, representing fields ranging from engineering to business to philosophy, were asked to come up with solutions that will allow Canada to begin its transition to a low-carbon economy. The group has put forward 10 key recommendations. Chief among them is a national tax on carbon.  We think this is a fundamental one, you can consider it the floor under our feet,  says Potvin. The price of carbon would be identical across all the provinces, something most political parties have been reluctant to endorse thus far in the election. SCD wants to see low-carbon electricity across Canada, a goal Potvin says can be achieved by 2035. The group is also calling for this kind of power to become Canada s major source of energy for buildings, transportation and industry. Although some might consider them lofty, Potvin says these targets are possible to reach, adding that in her cross-country presentations to unions, First Nations groups and industry representatives, the goals were met enthusiastically.  When we launched this document, many people were quite pessimistic, and thinking we would have no traction,  says Potvin.  I ended up giving interviews coast to coast   and I was always met with the same comment:  Hey, Professor. What you re suggesting makes a lot of sense. Why aren t we doing it?  On the political side, SCD is trying to draw attention to what different parties are promising in advance of the October 19 election. Damon Matthews , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability, contributed to Potvin s project to analyze political parties  climate platforms.  SCD is a very impressive effort to bring such a diverse group of academics together to envision a more sustainable Canada.  Potvin calls Canada s current carbon-reduction program a  smokescreen.   What we want is a plan to meet the target, and currently Canada does not have one   there s a target with no plan,  she says. It s something SCD hopes will change with the next government. Beyond political or scientific concerns, Potvin has a personal desire to see the project succeed.  I have a granddaughter, and two grandsons,  she says.  It s my way of doing what I can to ensure that they have a future that is worthwhile.    Catherine Potvin s lecture,  Acting on Climate Change: Mobilizing Society to Find Solutions,  will take place at the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall on the Loyola Campus (7141 Sherbrooke W.) on Thursday, October 15, at 8 p.m. Find out more about the Science College public lecture series .

This op-ed was recently published in the Montreal Gazette . Reading the Leap Manifesto was a startling and inspiring experience. Launched on September 15 by Naomi Klein and an impressive list of signatories , the Leap presents a remarkable vision of change that is both necessary and possible to achieve. In a political climate where climate change has been all but forgotten, reading such a clear and compelling call to abandon fossil fuel energy sources within the next few decades was like waking from a bad dream. I have worked as a climate scientist and researcher for more than a decade. I and others have shown how each emission of carbon dioxide leads to a discrete and essentially irreversible increase in world temperatures. We have shown that a zero-carbon emissions target is the only one that will stabilize global temperatures, and that the world therefore has a finite carbon budget that we must not exceed if we want to stabilize at an increase of 2 C or any other level. We have calculated how small this carbon budget actually is   something like three decades  worth of current emissions   and shown just how far the current national emissions pledges are from meeting the 2 C target. And I have worked with friends and colleagues to show how current investments in fossil fuel infrastructure commit us to decades of continued emissions and climate warming. I understand just how difficult it will be to limit emissions to a level that will prevent dangerous climate changes. I understand also that another degree of global warming will not be pleasant for much of the world, and will very likely be dangerous for the rest. Here in Canada, we could lose the ability to play hockey outdoors in the winter; but this pales in comparison to the potential for widespread loss of coral reefs, or sea-level rise that threatens low-lying island countries. A 2 C world will be a different and more dangerous one. But a 3 C world will be much more dangerous, and a 4 C world possibly catastrophic. So fossil fuels will not be the energy source of this future world. There is really no other alternative. This is why the vision of the Leap Manifesto is so compelling. The call for a dramatic and rapid transition to an economy fuelled by renewable energy is exactly what is necessary, and what is consistent with the science of global warming. But the Leap Manifesto is also a clear statement that it is possible to define a better world. And this is where its real power lies. For too long now, the demands of limiting global warming to 2 C have been seen as too high, too hard and too expensive. As a country and as an international community, we have stopped believing that we can meet the challenge of climate change. Why have we lost this belief? For more than two decades, the need to act to stop driving global temperatures upwards has been clear and supported by solid scientific evidence. But for every scientific step forward, there has been an onslaught of denial telling us to doubt both the reality and the severity of global warming. It is no surprise that we would come to doubt also our ability to rise to the climate challenge. Humanity is capable of pulling off dramatic and rapid change. Tipping points are possible and once crossed can take us quickly to new ways of living that do not depend on carbon-intensive energy. We can build a new and more just global society in time to avoid the most dangerous outcomes. But fundamentally, we have to believe that this is possible. In short, we can Leap.

The World Science Forum has convened every two years since 2001, in an effort to bring together leading scientists, international science organizations, science advisors and political decision makers. The goal of this year s forum, held last week in Budapest, was to promote the  Enabling Power of Science  by highlighting the role and potential of science to inform solutions to current global challenges. One important set of global challenges is articulated in the  Sustainable Development Goals,  which were ratified by the United Nations in September of this year. There are 17 global goals, which cover development priorities such as decreasing world poverty and hunger, improving access to water, health services and sustainable energy, addressing gender and other inequalities, promoting environmental protection, and encouraging action on climate change. Breaking silos A common theme of the discussions and presentations in Budapest was the interconnection between these goals and their many individual targets, and the need to break silos and stimulate collaboration across disciplines to generate innovative solutions.  As a climate scientist, I came to the World Science Forum with an interest in learning about how climate change science could contribute to global sustainability and development challenges. Climate change will likely have its most serious and dangerous consequences in developing countries. These impacts will exacerbate existing challenges, and in the long term could compromise our ability to achieve many of the sustainable development goals. But the details of these interactions between changes and other sustainability targets are complex and not well understood; the ways that changing patterns of rainfall, extreme weather and high temperatures could affect poverty, inequality, food and water security, health, migration, conflict, access to energy and overall economic development remain highly uncertain, and in some cases largely unknown. There is considerable potential for silo-breaking trans-disciplinary research to shed light on these questions. Climate action and sustainable development In the opening plenary of the conference, I was therefore quite dismayed to hear the idea of climate action dismissed as being an ineffective way to address global sustainability challenges, and a low priority compared to other more urgent needs. Bjorn Lomborg, president and founder of the Copenhagen Consensus Center , argued that investments in climate action would detract from potential investments in other development challenges such as poverty alleviation or improvements in health services. The clear implication of his argument was that we need to emphasize action on development priorities by using the most cost-effective strategies currently available to us, without worrying too much about the effects of these strategies on development s climate footprint. Lomborg s argument was a clear example of thinking that did not acknowledge the interactions between climate and sustainable development, nor the potentially very severe long-term climate impacts on the most vulnerable human societies. The magnitude of the climate challenge   that we need to eliminate the global use of fossil fuels within the next half-century   requires immediate action on decarbonization in developed countries, in addition to the mobilization of a tremendous amount of financial resources to assist with the development of sustainable energy technologies in the world s poorest countries. Of course there are urgent development needs that could be met now without addressing climate change; but to use this as an argument to dismiss climate action altogether is to trade off the future to meet the needs of the present generation. This is fundamentally at odds with the very essence of sustainable development. A lack of real engagement There were other, more progressive perspectives offered by other speakers in other sessions of the conference, and the declaration produced by the conference organizers did include a clear call to action on both climate change and the sustainable development goals. But I remained struck by a lack of real engagement between the climate research community and the discussion of what is needed to meet the very real and pressing needs of low- and middle-income countries. I think there is a real need to fill this gap, and to engage more actively on questions of how climate change research can be used to motivate and inform not just action on climate change, but also the ways that we seek to address other sustainable development goals. World Science Forum 2017 At the closing ceremony in Budapest, we were addressed by Princess Sumaya bint El Hassan of the royal family of Jordan, who will be hosting the next World Science Forum in 2017. She gave a remarkable speech, one that managed to be both critical and empowering in equal measure, and I was left feeling both inspired and excited to see what new ideas and perspectives would be brought to this next meeting. But one message from her address in particular resonated with me: that the most potent threat to global sustainability is short-term thinking.  Damon Matthews is an associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability. In 2014 he received the award for Research Communicator of the Year (International) for his work in identifying the world s greatest contributors to climate change .  His research is aimed at better understanding the many possible interactions between human activities, natural ecosystems and future climate change, and contributing to the scientific knowledge base required to promote the development of sound national and international climate policy.

That s the question driving the fifth edition of the Montr al Summit on Innovation (SMI 2015) taking place on Monday, November 30, at the Palais des congr s de Montr al . The conference was organized by the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, while Concordia set this year s theme, Climate (of) Change: Cities, People and Prosperity, and staff and faculty from the Office of Research developed the programming. Academics, decision makers and scientists will address the anticipated repercussions of climate change, as well as review exemplary practices in the areas of risk management strategy, investment and urban planning and social innovation. Alan Shepard , Concordia s president, will provide opening remarks, and 16 experts in their respective fields will lead sessions. David Suzuki is speaking in the early evening, as part of the Bell International Leaders series. Climate change:  also a huge business opportunity  The relationship between population growth and climate is a hot conference topic.  Adding 2.5 billion to urban populations by 2050, which is the projection, means building 2,500 cities of one million people each, within 35 years,  says conference speaker Paul Shrivastava , executive director of Concordia s Future Earth and the David O'Brien Distinguished Professor of Sustainable Enterprise at Concordia's John Molson School of Business .  Climate change will impact this rapid urbanization, and urbanization will impact climate. This is both a huge threat and also a huge business opportunity.  Shrivastava stresses that building the necessary urban infrastructure to house future generations will require good trans-disciplinary scientific understanding of the challenges, and visionary business and political leadership. A fully decarbonized economy The conference will include a scientific overview of the history of climate change by Damon Matthews , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability.  Climate action has been an international priority for more than 25 years and we ve delayed far too long,  says Matthews.  It is critical that we set a course now toward a fully decarbonized economy.   The magnitude of the climate challenge is staggering. We need to be off fossil fuels within half a century, and this will require action and innovation in every sector of our society. Here in Canada, our energy-policy decisions have been at direct odds with the priorities of climate action. The time has come to align our national energy policies with this new reality.\" In response to the serious nature of environmental warnings, the conference will conclude with a presentation of examples of innovative commercial, social and technological initiatives to deal with climate change. A challenge for humanity  The battle for climate change is, and will be, a challenge for humanity,  says Damien Sil s, executive director of Quartier de l innovation.  There s no plan B. The SMI is the Canadian forum on this subject in 2015, offering a foundation for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) this year.  Sil s is impressed with the conference lineup.  We ve attracted world-renowned speakers, and we hope to sensitize politicians and the business community to the major impact of the actual climate upheaval.   Now we re moving into action  Michel Leblanc, president and chief executive officer of the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, says he s pleased to be taking part in organizing the Montreal Summit on Innovation for the second year.  In the past, efforts went into raising awareness about climate change. Now we are moving into action,  he says.  Greenhouse gas emissions targets and the investments announced in Qu bec s Green Fund will create business opportunities. The Montreal Summit on Innovation will spotlight these opportunities, along with the economic impact of climate change on Montreal and all of Quebec.  Students must register by phone, and their tickets are $85. Adult tickets are between $275 and $350. Admission to David Suzuki s talk starts at $35.

Now she s earned a BSc with Honours in Environmental Science along with the Governor General s Academic Silver Medal, given to the graduating bachelor s-degree-level student with the highest marks.  My goal wasn t to win a medal. My goal was to learn as much as I could learn in order to make the most of my university experience and to do the best that I could do,  says Graham.  It is definitely an honour, but I could never have done it on my own.  She credits the support of people at Concordia, from professors and peers to staff in Counselling and Development, as among those who made her achievement possible. Indeed, she chose the university because it allowed people like her, who d been out of school for a while, to find their feet as independent students and explore options across programs. It was a geography class that ultimately captured her imagination.  I really wanted to learn about how nature works,  says Graham, who switched to the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment.  It is a fascinating program. We learn about water, climate, forestry, geology, ecology, as well as environmental issues associated with each of these.  Her honours research was a global evaluation that will provide conservationists with an estimate of the magnitude of climatic changes that primates will face. This type of analysis hasn t been done before, Graham says.  Tanya is an exceptional student, the best I have ever taught or supervised, and she certainly deserves the recognition,  says Damon Matthews, Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability and an associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment.  She works hard, sets high standards on her work and consequently produces consistent excellent results.  Graham also managed to fit in part-time work at Concordia, facilitating tutorial sessions for an introductory geography course, and to volunteer as a teaching assistant for English as a Second Language classes. She found that helping others refreshed her mentally and spiritually and renewed her energy for her own studies. It was a good lesson in life balance. Graham, who d like to pursue a master s degree, learned some other important lessons during her time at the university:  Don t underestimate yourself and what you are capable of. Take advantage of every opportunity, even if you are scared to death about it.

Behind the Hingston Hall residences on the Loyola Campus, students are busily working work their way down rows of leafy greens, cutting off the larger leaves an inch above the ground. They pull radishes, pick strawberries, harvest herbs and pluck flowers to use as garnishes; then wash the produce and place it in wicker baskets, ready for sale. Large bags of mixed greens go for $4, and small bags for $3. Radishes cost $1 a bushel.   The workers are all members of City Farm s new eight-month Market Gardener Internship: on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., they sell their produce from a market stand at the school. Any revenue goes first to paying for the seeds and seedlings purchased in the spring   but everything left over is clear profit.    The idea is to get the students thinking about the economics of gardening and farming, especially in a market setting,  City Farm co-coordinator Jackie Martin says.   In March, at the start of the internship, Market Gardeners are divided into four small groups, each with its own plot. Then they are given specific challenges: to grow four plant families; to practise  companion planting,  that is, planting different crops close together to increase productivity; and to build trellises out of discarded materials. They must also let at least one species go to seed so they can collect its seeds at the end of the season.    One student, Josianne Boucher, takes a few moments to show off the plants growing in the packed four-by-five-and-a-half-metre plot tended by her group.  These are our tomatillos,  she says.  It s a Mexican fruit, and you can make salsa verde with it. Those are tomatoes, that s basil, and up there we have eggplants.    She points to a group of plants growing up a trellis constructed out of three old bicycle wheels.  That s a mix of beans and cucumbers. Those are peppers up there in the middle. That s parsley, that s cilantro, kale, and on the other side there is Swiss chard.    It s the first year that City Farm School students have been given their own plots alongside the ones managed by the two City Farm School coordinators, Martin and Marcus Lobb.  They design the whole thing from scratch,  Martin says.  They decide where the rows are going to grow, and what plants they want.    Student Emmalee Biebl washes produce. So far, Martin says, the experiment is working very well.  They make whatever decisions they want. Sometimes they make the same decisions as we do, and sometimes they ll do something totally different. Some stuff they ve done has turned out way better than what we ve done!    As well as the Market Gardener Internship, the school is offering two other new programs this year: a Medicinal Plants Internship, for people who want to learn about growing and using medicinal herbs, and a Schoolyard Gardener Internship, in which interns work alongside five-to-12-year-olds in established gardens at Montreal schools.    All City Farm internships last eight months, starting in March in Concordia s Henry F. Hall Building greenhouse on the Sir George Wlliams Campus and running until the end of the growing season.   For intern Emmalee Biebl, who works as a barber, the Market Stand Internship is a great opportunity to learn about planting and harvesting in an informal setting.  This is the first opportunity I had to do a gardening course, and still work,  she says.  I don t know where this will take me, but it s definitely something I want to do.

Download the free app that could redefine transportation in Montreal Posted on September 13, 2013 | By: Christian Durand Calling all Concordians: Zachary Patterson (right) is using an app to find out how faculty, staff and students commute. Photo by Concordia University One solution may be a few taps of the finger away. Zachary Patterson   a Canada Research Chair and assistant professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment   has developed DataMobile, an origin-destination smartphone app that he hopes will give transit authorities better information on how we move. A former transportation planner with Agence m tropolitaine de transport (AMT), Patterson is calling on students, staff and faculty to use the application between September 16 and October 6. With the data collected, he will look at whether the quality of the information is as reliable as origin-destination surveys conducted over the phone. As city dwellers studying or working on an urban campus, the chaos of traffic-heavy commutes is something many of us have learned to live with. After all, what can we do about it? The DataMobile app is free and available for iPhone and Android devices. Image courtesy of Phil Viau But Patterson says this approach doesn t make more traditional forms of information gathering obsolete. Since mobile data-collection apps are still in their infancy, much remains to be understood about how to interpret and complement the types of information they collect. In fact, the traditional telephone survey remains an integral part of how transportation agencies understand commuting habits. By tapping into smartphone technology, Patterson is taking a big-data approach to origin-destination studies: now that most mobile phones are equipped with GPS, applications like DataMobile are able to capture massive amounts of information quickly and non-invasively.  Cities across North America have to make important decisions when it comes to where to invest in expensive infrastructure projects,  he says.  The richer the data that transport planners have at their disposal, the better informed they will be when it comes to allocating scarce resources.   In Montreal, for example, data gathered through telephone origin-designation surveys   like the one taking place this fall   are being used to evaluate the impact of three subway extensions that are under consideration,  Patterson says.  The last survey cost close to $1.5 million and took three months. This may seem like a lot, but the results serve to evaluate infrastructure investments worth billions of dollars.  And those investments will save us all the continuing frustration and lost time caused by traffic messes. So have your say by downloading the DataMobile app: it s simple, non-invasive and an excellent way of taking part in research that is making a difference. However   if the phone rings and you don t recognize the number, answer it. Patterson says it could very well be the AMT calling.  Your input will literally shape the future of transportation networks.  How it works Access the App Store or Google Play Store and download DataMobile for free. Launch the application and fill out a two-minute survey. Let the application run in the background for a maximum of two weeks. Wait to see if you win an iPad 2.

When it comes to global warming, there are seven big contributors: the United States, China, Russia, Brazil, India, Germany and the United Kingdom. A new study published in Environmental Research Letters reveals that these countries were collectively responsible for more than 60 per cent of pre-2005 global warming. Uniquely, it also assigns a temperature-change value to each country that reflects its contribution to observed global warming. The study was conducted at Concordia under the leadership of Damon Matthews, an associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment. In a straight ranking, the U.S. is an unambiguous leader, responsible for a global temperature increase of 0.15 C. That s close to 20 per cent of the observed warming. China and Russia account for around eight per cent each; Brazil and India seven per cent; and Germany and the U.K. around five per cent each. Canada comes in tenth place, right after France and Indonesia. Although it may seem surprising that less industrialized countries, including Brazil and Indonesia, ranked so highly, their positions reflect carbon dioxide emissions related to deforestation. In the study, the research team used a new methodology to calculate national contributions to global warming. It weighted each type of emission according to the atmospheric lifetime of the temperature change it caused. Using data from 1750 onward, the team accounted for carbon dioxide contributions from fossil fuel burning and land-use change, along with methane, nitrous oxide and sulphate aerosol emissions. Matthews and his colleagues also experimented with scaling the emissions to the size of the corresponding area (see graphic above). Western Europe, the U.S., Japan and India are hugely expanded, reflecting emissions much greater than would be expected based on their geographic area. Russia, China and Brazil stay the same. Taken in this light, the climate contributions of Brazil and China don t seem so out of line   they are perfectly proportionate to the countries  land masses. Canada and Australia become stick thin as their land mass is much larger than their share of the global-warming pie. Meanwhile, dividing each country s climate contribution by its population paints a different picture. Amongst the 20 largest total emitters, the top seven per capita positions are occupied by developed countries, with Canada falling in third place behind the U.K. and the U.S. In this ranking, China and India drop to the bottom of the list. Matthews s study highlights how much individual countries have contributed to the climate problem, as well as the huge disparity between rich and poor with respect to per-person contributions to global warming. Acknowledging these disparities, and then moving to correct them, may be a fundamental requirement for success in efforts to decrease global greenhouse-gas emissions. * Parts of this text appear courtesy of New Scientist magazine.

Freak snowstorms. Devastating tsunamis. Polar vortexes. The Earth s climate is undeniably becoming increasingly volatile. A number of professors and students from Concordia s four academic faculties are examining the effects of climate change and looking for ways to sustain human activities without depleting the Earth s resources. Their research and teaching are serving as scientific warnings, opening up exciting new opportunities revolving around sustainability and deepening human understanding and awareness. We present a few of their efforts. Skating on thin ice Damon Matthews is an associate professor in Concordia s department of geography, planning and environment. He says it s not too late to stop the rise of the earth s temperature   and the decline of outdoor ice hockey   but it would require  prompt and significant action.  When Damon Matthews co-published a 2012 paper warning that the days of Canada s outdoor skating rinks could be numbered, the associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment received more media atten tion than he ever had before. Hockey in Canada is, after all, sacred.  Based on the conditions needed to create outdoor rinks and what we ve observed from the meteorological data over the previous 30 years, we extrapolated that we have about three more decades of viable outdoor skating,  Matthews says.  That really touched a cultural nerve among Canadians that I hope will help lead to significant action in terms of reducing carbon emissions.  Matthews uses mathematical calcula tions to model climate response to carbon dioxide (CO2) and other emissions.  The ratio is a 1.5-degree-Celsius-higher global temperature for every trillion tonnes of carbon emitted into our atmosphere,  he explains.  And while it took us 200 years to emit a half-trillion tonnes, it will take us only 50 years to emit another half-tril lion at current levels.  With carbon emissions still increasing, that additional 500 billion tonnes might occur even sooner, he adds. The only way to stop the planet from warming further is to stop emissions im mediately.  Of course, zero emissions are unlikely to happen overnight because people won t decommission current production and transportation systems or change their habits that quickly,  Matthews says. Matthews and his Concordia colleagues have therefore looked at the amount of emissions already embedded into the cur rent fossil fuel infrastructure to determine the amount of  wiggle room  to stabilize the increase in the Earth s overall temper ature to only 2 degrees Celsius.  If we want global warming to stay below 2 degrees Celsius, we need to cut all emissions by at least half,  he says. Given this reality, some researchers are proposing to remove CO2 from the atmosphere to keep global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.  That s when people start talking about geo-engineering projects, such as artificial trees to suck CO2 from the atmosphere,  Matthews says. He s conducting simulations to de termine how the climate might respond to some of the proposed technological solutions.  For instance, one idea is to spray reflective particles into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight,  Matthews says.  However, that would introduce a whole other suite of potential side effects on the climate system, such as impacts on the ozone layer and changes in rainfall patterns.  His modelling indicates that reaching zero emissions as soon as possible through renewable energy sources and significant changes in our lifestyle and habitat remains the best solution. To show what needs to be done, one of his recent projects involved calculating the historical emissions produced by nations and how each country s emissions are contributing to the global tempera ture increase.  Of course, the United States produces the most emissions, and Canada ranked 10th, which is not very good given its relatively small popula tion,  he says.  We re hoping this kind of information will spur governments to action.  There s a misconception that even if we stopped emitting carbon, the Earth s temperature would continue to rise, and that s not the case,  he emphasizes.  We could stabilize the planet s temperature if we take prompt and significant ac tion.  It s why Matthews conducts studies that alert people to the fact that if carbon emissions aren t dramatically curbed without delay, other young boys and girls might not have the chance to learn hockey on an outdoor rink like Wayne Gretzky did. If carbon emissions aren t dramatically curbed without delay, other young boys and girls might not have the chance to learn hockey on an outdoor rink like Wayne Gretzky did, Raising awareness through art Ricardo Dal Farra, an associate professor in the Department of Music, has worked on several balance-unbalance conferences. balance-unbalance merges art and issues of sustainability. Research in the fine arts has a less obvious connection to sustainability than that of other disciplines   but Ricardo Dal Farra, an associate professor in the Department of Music, is helping change that perception. Dal Farra has been a leading organizer of three international BALANCE-UNBALANCE conferences that have brought artists together with scientists, engineers, sociologists, policymakers and others to help resolve the world s pressing environmental issues. BALANCE-UNBALANCE 2011 involved the collaboration of colleagues from Concordia s departments of Geography, Planning and Environment, Political Science, Design and Computation Arts, Communication Studies and Music, as well as the David O Brien Centre for Sustainable Enterprise. The highly successful 2013 BALANCE-UNBALANCE conference was held at the UNESCO-designated Noosa Biosphere in Queensland, Australia. It prompted the Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre to approach Dal Farra about creating some original music to play during their presentations and workshops, as well as games that the organization uses to help government officials and other key people to understand the complexities of disaster risk management. Dal Farra suggested a contest to find original music and sound-art works for the climate centre s overall humanitarian responses to people dealing with floods, drought and other disasters related to climate change.  Pablo Suarez, the centre s associate director for Research and Innovation, was so pleased that he asked if we could also launch a contest for music miniatures specifically for the efforts to obtain mosquito nets to prevent dengue fever,  Dal Farra says. The contests have been a springboard for the  art!   climate  project, which aims to use art as a catalyst for social awareness and change.  To compose a piece about climate change or dengue fever, you really have to understand what the problem is, so the contest rules prompted entrants to read white papers and other documents about climate change and its consequences,  Dal Farra says.  The contests encouraged sound artists to reflect significantly on the situation and what kind of message they wanted to get across.  A jury of highly regarded composers and media artists chose 39 submissions as being of very good quality from among the large number received. The climate centre selected nine compositions for its purposes. Dal Farra and the other contest organizers are programming many of the remaining high-quality pieces into conferences and festivals related to climate change around the world.  We re also in the process of putting all the pieces on a website  with a Creative Commons licence that gives organizations and individuals the permission to download and use them in connection with any initiatives specifically related to dealing with climate change,  he says. The response and outcome of the initial contests were so successful that the  art!   climate  project and BALANCE-UNBALANCE conference series were featured in the April 2013 issue of Leonardo   Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology.  We really have shown how art can play a fundamental role in social change,  Dal Farra says.  It s a message that I keep emphasizing to my students by integrating issues related to climate change in my teaching and making them a part of the curriculum activities for my composition of electroacoustic music classes.   We really have shown how art can play a fundamental role in social change,  Dal Farra says. Creating new value from old goods Department of Marketing associate professor Zeynep Arsel s research includes looking at  upcycling,  the process of taking someone else s trash and turning it into something of value. A lamp from the 1980s may be nothing but junk to a lot of us. Yet some people would love to get their hands on one. It s this kind of unprecedented value for items that Zeynep Arsel, an associate professor in the Department of Marketing at the John Molson School of Business (JMSB), is researching as a consumption scholar. She s looking at how people s evolving ideas of what holds value might help to save the planet s resources.  I am increasingly seeing people desire items in ways that were unimaginable in the past,  Arsel says.  And I m examining how that desire could help to avoid resource depletion in the long run.  Arsel s research is focused on how people are creating value by trading items that wouldn t otherwise be marketable.  This includes exchanging unsellable items, such as used makeup,  she notes. Her current project involves examining various forms of exchange within Canada and the United States that exist outside the formal marketplace, such as bartering.  I m investigating how people are creating and maintaining systems that I would say make up for the limitations of the formal marketplace,  she explains. She is also looking at upcycling   the process of using what would otherwise become trash to create new items, such as leather bags from worn jackets.  People are really starting to recognize the dormant value of the items in their closets and cupboards and putting that into action,  she says.  I m researching this in terms of the concept of value which I think needs to be re-theorized in light of these relatively new activities.  The growing popularity of the Freecycle Network , which claims nearly eight million participants around the world, provides another example. The site helps individuals to pass along and receive items for free.  People are using the site to give things away because they realize the value in creating more space for themselves, or they want to increase their moral capital by helping others in the process of facilitating the reuse of items rather than just discarding them,  Arsel says.  I think there may be a real con sciousness-awakening here.  Arsel is noticing that as some are becoming more aware of the dormant value in used and upcycled items, they are creating formal marketplaces for them. Entrepreneurs are establishing upcycling businesses. Organizations are opening thrift shops to raise money for medical research or charitable efforts. For now, Arsel is focusing on value that isn t determined by a monetary amount.  I m more interested in floating value,  she says.  What is it that makes  people decide that a used object is worth something? What is it that makes some of us seek out items that others consider junk or garbage? What determines a fair exchange? How is it that a book could end up being a fair trade for a chair?  Arsel has received a wide array of answers so far, which is making it a real challenge to establish some kind of shared criteria.  It s very subjective,  she emphasizes.  What s interesting is that people are not just exchanging physical items in many cases, but objects that come with stories that form part of their value structure.  As more networks for bartering or swapping become established, Arsel suspects that society s mainstream notions of value might also keep shifting. She speculates:  Fixed currencies might become less important in determining exchanges.  Arsel s research is focused on how people are creating value by trading items that wouldn t otherwise be marketable.  This includes exchanging unsellable items, such as used makeup,  she notes.

Concordia research shows which countries are most responsible for the cost of environmental damage from global warming Posted on September 8, 2015 | By: Cl a Desjardins All countries have contributed to recent climate change, but some much more so than others. Those that have contributed more than their fair share have accumulated a climate debt, owed to countries that have contributed less to historical warming. This is the implication of a new study published in Nature Climate Change, in which Concordia University researcher Damon Matthews shows how national carbon and climate debts could be used to decide who should pay for the global costs of climate mitigation and damages. The countries that have accumulated the largest carbon debts on account of higher than average per-capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. The U.S. alone carries 40 per cent of the cumulative world debt, while Canada carries about four per cent. On the other side, the carbon creditors   those whose share of CO2 emissions has been smaller than their share of world population   are India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, Brazil and China, with India holding 30 per cent of the total world credit.   Thinking of climate change in terms of debts and credits for individual countries shows how much countries have over- or under-contributed to historical warming, relative to their proportion of the world s population over time,  explains Matthews, study author and associate professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment.  This paints a striking picture of the historical inequalities among countries with respect to their greenhouse gas emissions and consequent responsibility for climate changes.  Calculating climate responsibility To estimate differences in national responsibility for historical climate changes, Matthews first calculated carbon debts and credits based on fossil fuel CO2 emission and population records since 1990. It was around this date that scientific knowledge and public understanding of the dangers of human-driven climate changes began to solidify. Since that time, the total carbon debt across all debtor nations has increased to 250 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. And it s still going up: the increase in world carbon debt in 2013 alone was 13 billion tonnes, or about 35 per cent of global CO2 emissions in that year. So what is the monetary value of this debt?  According to a recent U.S. government report, the current best estimate of the social cost of present-day CO2 emissions is about $40 USD per tonne of CO2,  says Matthews.  Multiply $40 by the 13 billion tonnes of carbon debt accrued in 2013, and you get $520 billion. This cost estimate gives us an indication of how much we could be paying to help lower-emitting countries cope with the costs of climate changes, or develop their economies along carbon-free pathways.  Looking at the total world carbon debt, the numbers are even more staggering: the 250 billion tonnes of debt accumulated since 1990, at $40 per tonne, represents $10 trillion USD.  No matter how you look at this picture, these numbers are really big   much, much larger than even the most generous financial commitments currently pledged by countries to help with the cost of climate adaptation and damages in vulnerable countries.  CO2 emissions vs. degrees of debt Matthews also calculated how much each country has over- or under-contributed to temperature increases as a result of a range of different greenhouse gas emissions. By this measure, the total accumulated world climate debt comes to 0.1 C since 1990, close to a third of observed warming over this period of time. Again the U.S. is the single largest debtor, and India is the largest creditor. Some countries, however, like Brazil and Indonesia, switch from being carbon creditors, to being among the climate debtor countries, as a result of the additional greenhouse gas emissions produced by deforestation and agriculture.  This idea of climate and carbon debts and credits highlight the large historical inequalities with respect to how much individual countries have contributed to climate warming,  says Matthews.  The historical debts and credits calculated here could be a helpful tool to inform policy discussions relating to historical responsibility and burden sharing, by providing a measure of who should pay  and how much they might be expected to pay   for the costs of mitigation and climate damages in countries with lower emissions.  What does this mean for the upcoming Paris meetings? As countries continue to announce their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (or INDCs) leading up to December s climate talks in Paris, it is becoming increasingly clear that these emissions pledges will not be enough to meet the international goal of limiting global warming to 2 C (see related research by Matthews  research group published last month in Environmental Research Letters ). The idea of additionally accounting for debts and credits would of course increase the burden placed on countries with high historical emissions.  But these historical inequalities are real and substantial, and need to be fully acknowledged,  says Matthews.  My hope is that this discussion will help lead to a stronger and more meaningful global climate agreement.    Find out more about research in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment .

As vice president of the Freshwater program at World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF-Canada), Snider is overseeing the first centralized database of Canadian freshwater and its biggest threats. WWF-Canada recently rolled out the benchmarking project Watershed Reports: Taking the Pulse of Canada s Rivers. The interactive website provides a timely assessment of Canada s 25 major watersheds   the interconnected rivers, wetlands and lakes that drain into a common body of water. The World Wildlife Fund's Watershed Reports is an online tool that reports the health of Canada's water systems. | Courtesy: World Wildlife Fund The user-friendly tool aims to convey information clearly, for all to understand. It appeals to scientists, recreational outdoor enthusiasts and even schoolchildren. It shows completed assessments for half of Canada s watersheds and WWF-Canada estimates it will complete the remainder by 2017. Watershed Reports assesses the health of a water system based on water flow, water quality, bugs and fish. Seven criteria are used to rank threats: pollution, climate change, overuse of water, alteration of flows, invasive species and habitat loss and fragmentation. Concordia experience paved the way Snider says his graduate diploma in environmental assessment helped prepare him for his role as the project s leader. James Snider, GrDip 07, leads the WWF-Canada Watershed Reports project.  At Concordia I was lucky to get a nature conservation internship, because that served as my bridge into the not-for-profit environmental sector,  he says.  I learned hard skills and soft skills that landed me a job with WWF six months after graduating.  A teacher s assistant while at Concordia, Snider started out at WWF-Canada as a data-crunching geographic information system analyst. Now he supervises a Canada-wide team of specialists from WWF-Canada headquarters in Toronto. Although he considers himself more of a technician than a science communicator, he engages with different types of organizations, from conservation groups to government monitoring programs.  I m involved in projects at various levels across the country,  Snider says.  They pave the way for community programs and data collection to take place.  Canadians taking responsibility for water systems Recently the conservation sector has been focusing on empowering individuals and groups to help with large-scale projects such as Watershed Reports.  We re formatting a network approach,  Snider explains. He points to the importance of cross-organizational collaboration.  Citizen scientists, community groups, recreational campers and manufacturing plants all have a role to play in nature conservation.  The report s strong foundation of data will make it easier for advocacy organizations to inform high-level decision makers in policy and best-business practices. The goal is to have all of Canada s watersheds rated as  good condition  by 2025   although most of the watersheds assessed so far show concerning threat levels. Watershed Reports challenges Canadians to act. Its interactive map also displays volunteering and clean-up opportunities.  We want to see a broad audience log on to Watershed Reports, from a family of recreational campers to a construction company CEO,  Snider says.  Ultimately, we hope to provide better local water management from a national online platform.  #CUalumni ","title":"Fresh information on Canadian freshwater"},{"url":"http://www.concordia.ca/artsci/geography-planning-environment/news/archive/cunews/main/stories/2015/11/18/new-agreement-between-quebecs-universities-province-opens-access-to-geospatial-data.html","body":"Quebec s universities gain access to a trove of Geospatial Data The new agreement with the province is a boon for researchers Posted on November 18, 2015 | By: Tom Peacock Sample data extracted from the Base de donn es topographique du Qu bec (1: 20 000). | Image courtesy of Minist re de l nergie et des ressources naturelles (MERN) The third week in November is Geography Awareness Week . And today, November 18, is Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Day ,  recognized internationally as an opportunity for GIS users to demonstrate how the technology is being used to make a difference in our society.  What better occasion to announce a new agreement between Quebec s universities and the Minist re de l nergie et des ressources naturelles (MERN) that provides unprecedented access to a wide range of geospatial data products? The agreement, negotiated by the Bureau de coop ration interuniversitaire (BCI), means that a large trove of government information  road and address networks, topographic maps, cadastral and LIDAR data, and orthophotos (geometrically corrected aerial images)  will now be readily available to researchers at the province s post-secondary institutions.  Big data has become crucial to answering large questions facing society,  says Concordia s university librarian Guylaine Beaudry, who participated in the negotiations along with geospatial and data services librarian Alex Guindon.  By increasing access to almost all geospatial data produced by the Quebec government, this agreement will make it easier to advance research and scholarship in Quebec,  says Beaudry. Geospatial data is anything that identifies geographical features and boundaries on the planet. This includes the coordinates and topology of natural structures, construction projects, oceans and more. It s often assessed, manipulated or analyzed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Guindon says the use of GIS across disciplines is booming.  So, anyone who may need to look at aerial photos, elevation data, road networks and detailed topographic maps will benefit tremendously from these newly available datasets.  Andr  Roy, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science , says the announcement is great news for students and researchers across numerous departments.  It will enhance our ability to represent, understand and solve a wide range of problems related to the environment and to our society.  Some of the newly available datasets cover the whole province of Quebec, and the resolution is superior to what was previously available from the federal government. Pascale Biron from the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment says this is important, because students who may have previously chosen to focus their research on other areas, including the United States  for which geospatial data was more readily available   will now be more likely to conduct their projects locally.  It s an opportunity for everyone to get to know their environment a bit better, and it's only positive to make sure that such data are available,  she says. Discussions with the government were a collective process, involving major contributions from colleagues from other universities. With the support of researchers, both librarians and civil servants at MERN worked together towards the common goal of improving access to geospatial data. For her part, Beaudry says she s proud of the role played by the province s university library system in supporting access to geospatial data. She adds that, for Concordia, the initiative fits in well with the new strategic directions .   By improving our local and global understandings of populations, places and communities, this new agreement contributes to the conditions that will help us double our research and teach for tomorrow.

Daniel Horen Greenford One example of the kind of research underway in the lab is Daniel Horen Greenford s ongoing Master s thesis project, in which he s attempting to calculate national contributions to climate change using his own formalizations of emissions accounting. If real change is to occur, says Horen Greenford, leaders and experts need to learn from the mistakes of past global initiatives. Horen Greenford uses the example of the Kyoto Protocol as a climate policy that hurt more than it helped. It allowed manufacturing to be displaced to non-signatory countries whose factories pollute more per unit than those in the developed nations where production originated. The phenomenon is known as  carbon leakage,  and it has caused a net increase in global emissions. At the same time, developed nations are able to congratulate themselves on meeting their reduction targets.   This standard has allowed wealthy nations to dislocate their emissions in order to meet their reduction targets while global emissions still rise,  Horen explains.  It s like a high school bully forcing another kid to hide contraband when the teacher checks his bag.  A different way of tracking emissions To tackle this issue, Horen Greenford is developing a new accounting method that effectively captures the effects of trade and allocates emissions embodied in goods to trading partners in a fair way. The model weighs emissions according to their economic benefit, using a definition of utility rooted in ethical considerations of necessity, while respecting geographical circumstances and cultural plurality. The production of goods is weighted in accordance with their utility. Essential items have the highest levels of utility while luxury items have the lowest. Weighting penalizes nations less for consuming goods that are more useful and holds populations more responsible for items they consume that are not necessary for survival. For example, a region that has a lot of cars should assume responsibility for the emissions used in the production of their vehicles in other countries, especially when producing regions do not have high car-ownership rates.  We must provide an account of emissions that better captures responsibility for emissions and can be used to hold nations accountable accordingly in international policy agreements,  says Horen Greenford.  This boils down to how we tabulate national inventories. By including emissions embodied in traded goods into national inventories, a better case can be made for bringing more countries to the negotiating table   one that is more robust and has greater considerations of equity.  Facing climate change in our city This model could also be used at the municipal level, too, says Horen Greenford. An urban inventory of all goods and services imported and exported could be traced across the supply chain to give cities a sense of their global impact on greenhouse gas emissions.  Here in Montreal, figuring out how we are impacting climate change would help policy and inform businesses and governments to make better choices when it comes to urban planning and infrastructure investment.

This op-ed was  recently published in the Montreal Gazette . With the adoption of the Paris Agreement , the world has finally struck a deal to fight climate change. The goal  to hold temperatures to  well below 2  C  and pursue  efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5  C   is impressively ambitious. If we can achieve this, we stand a good chance of avoiding some truly dangerous climate impacts. On the other hand, the Paris Agreement does not include mechanisms to compel countries to act, and countries  current emissions commitments will not be enough to achieve the agreement s temperature goal. The success or failure of the Paris Agreement will therefore depend entirely on the collective actions of all nations in the years to come. And achieving the 2 C target let alone 1.5 C  will require strong action on every front. The Paris Agreement states that countries should seek to  reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible   and to undertake rapid reductions   so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century.  This is unfortunately not the clearest of statements. So here is what it actually means: To stabilize global temperatures at any level, we need to stop adding carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Net emissions from human activity must eventually reach zero, such that any continued emissions are balanced by an equivalent amount of intentional removal from the atmosphere. To meet the 2 C goal, this net-zero target must be reached by the year 2070. To stay below 1.5 C, we have to hit net-zero by closer to 2050. Meeting the 2 C target will be hard. Staying below 1.5 C will be even harder. Impossible? Only if we don t try hard enough. Encouragingly, there is now some evidence of progress. According to new emissions data from the Global Carbon Project published last week in Nature Climate Change, global CO2 emissions have been stable since 2013. Emissions from 2013-2014 increased by only 0.6 per cent (compared to 2.5 per cent increases in previous years), and emissions in 2015 may have actually decreased back to 2013 levels. This is the result of decreased coal use in China coupled with rapid global growth of non-fossil energy sources, and marks the first time that emissions have not increased during a time of global economic expansion. It may be that a  global peaking  of CO2 emissions has occurred sooner than we dared to imagine possible. And if nations take up the challenge of the Paris Agreement, this might even be enough to move us further along a decreasing emissions trajectory. Canada has an opportunity to step up and lead this global effort. According to researchers at Stanford University, Canada could transition to 100 per cent renewable energy sources by 2050, using a combination of wind, solar and hydro power. This is the bar we have to set for ourselves. We have both the responsibility and the ability to act to cut our emissions more quickly than the rest of the world. It is therefore essential that the target of eventual net-zero emissions be internalized at every level of decision-making. New energy infrastructure needs to be carbon-free, and existing fossil fuel energy infrastructure needs to be either decommissioned or retrofitted with carbon capture technology. New buildings should be built to be powered by renewable energy technology, and existing buildings retrofitted with new energy technologies. New vehicles should be built without internal combustion engines, and existing gasoline-powered vehicles phased out. None of this is impossible. It is just a question of making the right choices. We need to realize and acknowledge that every greenhouse gas emission that we produce takes us incrementally closer to the level of climate change we need to avoid. We need to spend our remaining carbon budget with the utmost reticence and care. The Paris Agreement tells us where we need to go, but it will be up to us to choose the path that will take us there.

But what does that mean locally? A new study published in Nature Climate Change pinpoints the temperature increases caused by CO 2 emissions in different regions around the world. Using simulation results from 12 global climate models, Damon Matthews , a professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment , along with post-doctoral researcher Martin Leduc, produced a map that shows how the climate changes in response to cumulative carbon emissions around the world. They found that temperature increases in most parts of the world respond linearly to cumulative emissions.  This provides a simple and powerful link between total global emissions of carbon dioxide and local climate warming,  says Matthews.  This approach can be used to show how much human emissions are to blame for local changes.  Leduc and Matthews, along with co-author Ramo n de Eli a from Ouranos , a Montreal-based consortium on regional climatology, analyzed the results of simulations in which CO2 emissions caused the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to increase by 1 per cent each year until it reached four times the levels recorded prior to the Industrial Revolution. Globally, the researchers saw an average temperature increase of 1.7  0.4 C per trillion tonnes of carbon in CO2 emissions (TtC), which is consistent with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . But the scientists went beyond these globally averaged temperature rises, to calculate climate change at a local scale. At a glance, here are the average increases per trillion tonnes of carbon that we emit, separated geographically ( view the full table here ): Western North America 2.4   0.6 C Central North America 2.3   0.4 C Eastern North America 2.4   0.5 C Alaska 3.6   1.4 C Greenland and Northern Canada 3.1   0.9 C North Asia 3.1   0.9 C Southeast Asia 1.5   0.3 C Central America 1.8   0.4 C Eastern Africa 1.9   0.4 C  As these numbers show, equatorial regions warm the slowest, while the Arctic warms the fastest. Of course, this is what we ve already seen happen   rapid changes in the Arctic are outpacing the rest of the planet,  says Matthews. There are also marked differences between land and ocean, with the temperature increase for the oceans averaging 1.4   0.3 C TtC, compared to 2.2   0.5 C for land areas.  To date, humans have emitted almost 600 billion tonnes of carbon,  says Matthews.  This means that land areas on average have already warmed by 1.3 C because of these emissions. At current emission rates, we will have emitted enough CO 2 to warm land areas by 2 C within 3 decades.

Whether you re waiting for a bus that seems like it will never show up, or experiencing a sudden power outage on the subway, you are not alone: public transit woes are common around the world.   New research from Concordia uses mobile technology to map routes, calculate travel times and help alleviate some of the most pesky transport issues. Getting around in the developing world While transportation troubles might seem particularly painful in Western urban centres, they can be even more keenly felt in the developing world. That s why one of Zachary Patterson  s former students   now with the Agence fran aise de d veloppement  contacted him to map the public transit system in Ghana s capital, Accra. Patterson, an associate professor in the Department Geography, Planning and Environment , hopes the results of his project will help Western municipalities see how they can learn from these experiences in Africa.  Cities in the developing world face a common challenge when trying to better organize their transportation systems: they don t have accurate information about the transportation network that already exists,  says Patterson, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Transportation and Land Use Linkages for Regional Sustainability.  Because data collection is a complicated and costly exercise, city officials don t have the resources to thoroughly review their network,  he says.  That s why using inexpensive, readily available mobile technology is such a valuable tool.  The trouble with trotros At the heart of Accra s transit system is a fleet of small public transit buses known as trotros. The Accra Municipal Assembly has been working with AFD for a number of years to better regulate the trotro system. Initial regulatory steps identified and licensed routes, but the number of routes in operation and their actual itineraries, remained unknown. That s where Patterson, a former transportation planner with Agence m tropolitaine de transport in Montreal , came in. Accra s Department of Transport (DoT) and the Agence fran aise de d veloppement undertook a survey of the city s trotro routes armed with GPS-enabled smart phones to map the city s transit network with a very limited budget, and a short time frame. Using two mobile apps, DataMobile , which Patterson had initially developed at Concordia to map transportation habits in Montreal, and Tap Log , surveyors rode the trotros while recording GPS points and logging stops along the routes. The recorded data was then processed and analyzed by Patterson s research team back in Montreal. Ghost routes The results were surprising for both Patterson and Accra s city planners. They found that the transit network was full of  ghost routes    pathways that had been claimed by drivers but that weren t in use.  Drivers would preventatively register routes that they thought would one day be profitable in order to have a monopoly on them,  Patterson says.  Registering a route gives a driver the exclusive right to operate it, so that they can make sure that no competing driver can scoop them in the future.  These ghost routes were an important discovery for the DoT, as it provided a clearer sense of the actual extent of trotro services   315 active routes instead of the originally claimed 580. What s best for the West? The AccraMobile project was recently presented at the 95th annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board in the United States.  This study shows how international collaborations can play a role in helping developing countries to take advantage of leapfrogging technologies to plan their own transportation systems,  he says.

This spring you can acquire basic skills, get support for a project and learn how GIS could be relevant to your profession. From May 30 to June 3, Concordia s  Department of Geography, Planning and Environment  is offering a  new summer certificate course  for people seeking to enhance their GIS credentials.  GIS is a growing domain with more and more professional opportunities that range from data collection to map-making to software development,  says Angela Kross. | Photo by David Ward GIS collect, store, manipulate and analyze all sorts of spatial and geographical data.  This program is special because it provides a great alternative for participants to achieve basic or advanced GIS skills specifically tailored to their project needs, outside of a conventional academic-credit program,  says lecturer  Angela Kross , a geospatial technologies specialist who was hired in August 2015 to direct and teach the certificate.  We use geospatial tools such as GPS and Google Maps in our daily activities,  Kross says.  GIS is also a growing domain with more and more professional opportunities that range from data collection to map-making to software development.  The program is designed to offer maximum variability to participants, with two, three and five-day modules.  It s a flexible training setting tailored both to expertise levels and project-specific subject areas,  Kross explains. The idea for the program was born when the department noticed an increased demand for GIS skills training outside of the traditional 13-week theory-intensive course currently offered. In the summer certificate course, participants will learn how to use free GIS open-source software, collect and analyze their data and turn that information into visual representations that will help them effectively communicate. Storytelling is also a curriculum component.  They will learn how to tell stories using online mapping tools,  Kross says. In addition, participants will be exposed to a range of GIS projects led by the department s faculty, as well as by others enrolled in the program.  This will certainly expand the horizons of the participants in terms of what it is possible to achieve with GIS.  Networking opportunities and one-on-one consultations with subject-area specialists who use GIS in their research will be available throughout the program. Kross believes the new program will have broad appeal.  With things like smartphones and GPS devices, GIS is becoming increasingly necessary to many people and professional areas that have not traditionally used it,  she explains. Kross says the program will also hold appeal for those who need it for their research, a work requirement or professional development. Potential participants could include biology students who want to map disease, business students who want to pursue geography-related commercial opportunities and NGO members interested in community mapping.  Any student and professional with the beginning of an idea or a project involving geographic data would certainly benefit from this course.  While the program is just getting started, Kross sees potential for growth.  I am excited about the possibilities,  says Kross.  GIS is a fast-growing area, and with this program we will be able to quickly respond to the specific research and professional development needs of the participants.    The summer Geographic Information Systems (GIS) certification program runs from May 30 to June 3. Space is limited, and participants are encouraged to  sign up now . The cost for students and non-governmental organization (NGO) members is $100 per day, and the regular cost to participants is $375 per day.

On May 2, Canadians began receiving access codes to complete the questionnaire online by May 10. So many people rushed to the Statistics Canada census page that the site went down for 45 minutes . The census collects demographic information on every person in Canada. That data is used by governments, businesses, community organizations and others to make decisions at all levels. One in four households received the 36-page long-form questionnaire. The rest of Canadians will fill out the 10-question version. Both are mandatory. Zachary Patterson , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning, Environment , studies modelling of transportation, the environment, land-use and their linkages.  We asked him about the 2016 census and what it means for our nation.   Should Canadians be excited about this census? Zachary Patterson: Yes, they should. While the 2011 census was consistent and comparable with previous censuses, the National Household Survey was not. The National Household Survey replaced the \"Long form\" of the census. The NHS and Long form of the census collect more detailed information (revenues, ethnic background, employment status, sector of employment, etc.) on households than the census that collects basic information (number of people, ages, genders, etc.). Whereas the Long form of the census (administered to one in five households) was obligatory, the National Household Survey was not. This meant that its results were not comparable with previous information from previous censuses. As a result, this census will be the first time we will have comparable data about many aspects of the lives of Canadians in 10 years. In this digital information-gathering age, is a census still necessary? Doesn't Amazon (for example) have more useful and/or personal information about us? ZP: A census acts as a statistical/socio-demographic ground truth. Without the information provided by a census (i.e. the characteristics of an entire population), it is difficult to put many other types of data in to context   i.e. establish whether they are representative and what they actually represent. If one wants to make inferences about the Canadian population at almost any geographic level (country, province, CMA, census tract) knowledge of the characteristics of the population is necessary. Suppose you wanted to know how many people in the country owned a smartphone. To do this you sampled 1,000 people from across the country. If 800 of those people had a smartphone, how could you estimate how many people in the country had them without knowing the actual population? For the time being, a census is the most practical way to collect such information. There are other alternatives that may in the future be a feasible replacement, but they are fraught with difficulties. Many companies now collect a lot of information on their clients and users. Supposing a smartphone manufacturer collected information on phone owners. First, they probably don't have all information that would typically be collected in a census   they may know (or infer) gender and possibly age, but probably wouldn't know very much about occupation, education, revenue, etc. Second, not everyone has a smartphone, and no smartphone manufacturer makes all smartphones. As a result, it would be difficult to make inferences about the entire population just from smartphone information. It may be possible someday (as is done in some Scandinavian countries) to collect most required census information from existing datasources (e.g. income tax, provincial health insurance, etc.). At the same time, these sources are not necessarily comprehensive (not everyone files taxes), it may be difficult for the federal government to get information from data sources within provincial jurisdiction (e.g. health insurance records). As with the smartphone example above, there is also the problem of missing data. If, for example, people with lower revenues file taxes less, this would provide a distorted picture of revenues. Does census information assist your research and/or teaching at Concordia? If so, then how? ZP: Absolutely. Most of my research in one way or another requires census information. Statistics Canada told the CBC that  May 10 is not a hard deadline for filling out the cenus. However, the government organization is encouraging Canadians to complete the questionnaire as soon as possible in the coming days.

It was a celebration of collaborative design, and a chance to check out some cool new ideas for Montreal s parks. On April 28, Students and professors from Concordia and the Universit  de Montr al, and residents of the C te-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce (CDN NDG) borough gathered to mark the end of the first phase of an initiative to redesign two of its most popular green spaces. The project was conceived of as a way to build bridges between the borough s two districts, while drawing on the strengths of its universities. For part of it, 30 students from Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment were asked to re-imagine the site in front of the chalets of Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Park, on the corner of Girouard Avenue and Sherbrooke Street West, and Kent Park, on the corner of C te-des-Neiges Road and Kent Avenue.  From the beginning, we insisted that we shouldn't have a competition among the students, but instead work with them and the community in collaboration,  says Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor in the department, who was the university s lead academic on the project.  The outcome could be, for example, a monument, a plaza or an art installation,  says De la Llata.  The spaces will be completed and inaugurated in mid-2017 in the context of the city s 375th anniversary.  A user-driven design exercise The 30 Concordia students collaborated with 40 members of the public in a  design charrette,  consisting of two day-long sessions on-site at the parks  chalets.  A charrette is an intensive participatory design exercise in which professionals, scholars and/or students facilitate the visioning and conceptualization of an urban space or a project through a dialogue with the community,  De la Llata explains.  We had young people, elders, single and married people, dog owners, children, artists, and engineers. Each of them gave different inputs. Some mothers, for example, reported they would want to be able to watch their children in the playground but at the same time relax and have tea or coffee near the chalet.  Mainly, though, the design groups determined from the community members' input that they liked what was going on in the park already, De la Llata says. \"That is where the idea of the versatile/flexible platform came from   a space that is delivered to the community for them to transform, adapt and complete depending on the circumstances and needs.\" Jasmine Ali, an undergraduate student in  Urban Planning  and member of the Groupe NDG design team, says the involvement of the community was a key part of the process. \"It's their park, they go to it, they know more about it than us.\" In-situ design  A key idea behind the challenge was to plan the space from within the space itself, De la Llata says, explaining that the participants used ribbons, boxes and other items to delineate where elements of the design would be located.  This methodology, which we call  planning-in-situ,  is completely experimental   a method that democratizes urban design and planning. It involves conversations, presentations, walking tours, video-photographic analysis and sketching.\" At the end of the project, the Concordia students nominated two of their classmates, Ali and Faizan Jaffar   to receive internships worth $2,000 each. They ll work with the borough this summer to develop the park projects. \"I'm very grateful for this opportunity and looking forward to starting my internship,\" Ali says. \"As for my future plans, I'm looking towards continuing my education and doing a masters specifically in urban design.\" Jasmine Ali (pictured with borough mayor Russell Copeman) and Faizan Jaffar will receive internships worth $2,000 to develop the park projects. | Photos by Jean Beaudin for C te-des-Neiges Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Students from Universit  de Montr al s  landscape architecture department  also participated in a separate design charrette. Five teams from UdeM spent a weekend in Benny Library putting together their proposals. The first-place team was awarded a prize of $2,500, while the second-place team received $1,500.    A sense of unity and belonging   There was a lot of collegial and friendly collaboration among professors from UdeM and Concordia in the planning of the whole exercise,  De la Llata says.  We had meetings with city officials from the borough. They were very responsive to our proposals and adapted the exercise to suit the different needs of each school.  Borough mayor Russell Copeman, a Concordia alum and former associate vice-president of the university, was on hand to award prizes at the special event, held at La maison de la Culture C te-des-Neiges. The projects presented by the students from Concordia and UdeM are remarkable, said Copeman.  They fit directly into our vision for the 375th anniversary of Montreal, to support the sense of unity and belonging to all the citizens of our neighbourhoods, and to the common history of Montreal and our borough.\" For De la Llata, the experience illustrated the value of collaboration. \"It brings out the best in people,\" he says.  We're really proud of ourselves, as well as the community members of NDG and CDN, and everybody who participated in this project.   The spirit of this exercise is that these two public spaces, in which students and members of the community have collectively contributed their ideas, represent the union between two culturally and historically distinct neighbourhoods,  he adds.  It s a constructive dialogue between the past and the future of Montreal.  For more information, check out the  C te-des-Neiges Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce borough website  and Facebook page.

With GIS, you may find Mayan ruins   and more Concordia expert Angela Kross explains why the application of geographic information systems (GIS) has no limits Posted on May 12, 2016 | By: Angela Kross This ingenious use of GIS generated global excitement. | Photo by William Gadoury Earlier this week, a 15-year-old Quebecer made international headlines when it seemed he had discovered the  site of a lost Mayan city  using satellite imagery and star maps. Experts  have since raised doubts , but that doesn't detract from his innovative use of geographic information systems (GIS). Here  Angela Kross  director of Concordia's new  GIS summer certification course  explains why it's the way of the future.   Concordia's Angela Kross | Photo by David Ward 'GIS helps us understand places' The story about the ingenious teen who developed a hypothesis about the location of major Mayan sites in relation to major stars is fascinating. According to  different news sources , William Gadoury used transparent overlays of star charts and known Mayan site maps. When one major star did not match any site, he used satellite images to explore the location further. The process he used to develop and test his hypothesis involves some very typical and conventional geographic information system (GIS) tasks: the use of map overlays and satellite remote sensing. Satellite images allow us to observe and measure objects anywhere on earth, but interpretations need to be careful and validated. The satellite images in this case, for example, revealed a set of geometric structures (e.g. rectangles) under the vegetation canopy. It is hard to attribute these structures to natural phenomena. Man-made structures such as the Maya temples could cause such features in the images. But so could old abandoned agriculture fields, for example (or something else). Only a field expedition could give a true validation of this hypothesis, which could become a very difficult and expensive process. This is where GIS and remote sensing can play a very important role. For example, if the features were indeed caused by an old agriculture/corn field, satellite images of 5, 10 or 20 years ago could help explain the nature of the observed features. Spatial data and maps of communities that live around that area (if they exist) or maps of agriculture activities in that area would also help us understand whether the features could be caused by recent activities. All this information (satellite images and maps) can be displayed and analyzed using free open source or proprietary GIS software.   5 great uses of GIS The application of GIS has no limitations, as long as we have spatial information (location, location, location!). GIS can play a powerful role in assisting scientists, business specialists and community organizations validate hypotheses and communicate information and research from many domains. Biology and environmental health specialists, for example, may want to map the distribution of the Zika vector (mosquitoes) habitat worldwide. Will increasing temperatures push the boundaries of those habitats? An urban planner may want to map green spaces in the city to evaluate the need for increased green areas. A high school teacher may want to teach history classes using GIS storytelling: attaching dates to places and photos; all on Google Earth for example. An NGO may want to collect information from aboriginal communities to map the most important lands, according to them (participatory GIS). A transport company may want to know if their existing routes are actually covering the needs of the consumers. Where would new services be needed? GIS helps us to understand places, to detect and understand spatial patterns and to determine relationships between variables over time and space. GIS plays an important role in bridging multiple disciplines, and in enabling collaboration using one platform.

The lead facilitator is Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment .  The spirit of this project is that these two spaces, which will be collectively designed by the community, students and myself, represent the union between two culturally and historically different neighbourhoods as well as the dialogue between the past and the future of Montreal,  he says.  The outcome could be, for example, a monument, a plaza or an art installation. They ll be built and inaugurated in mid 2017 in the context of Montreal s anniversary.  User-driven design exercise Organizers are calling this weekend s outreach event a  design charrette,  consisting of two day-long sessions, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., on site at the parks  chalets.  A charrette is an intensive participatory design exercise in which professionals, scholars and/or students facilitate the visioning and conceptualization of an urban space/project through a dialogue with the community,  says De la Llata.  This methodology, which we call  planning-in-situ , involves conversations, presentations, walking tours, video-photographic analysis and sketching. We plan the space from within the space itself.  The designated parks for the project are Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Park, on the corner of Girouard Ave. and Sherbrooke Street West, and Kent Park, at the corner of Chemin de la C tes-des-Neiges and Kent. The first charrette is on Saturday, March 12, at Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Park, and the second charrette is on Sunday March 13 at Kent Park. Breakfast, lunch and coffee will be provided.

From May 30 to June 3, Concordia s  Department of Geography, Planning and Environment  is offering a  new summer certificate course  for people seeking to enhance their GIS credentials.  GIS is a growing domain with more and more professional opportunities that range from data collection to map-making to software development,  says Angela Kross. | Photo by David Ward GIS collect, store, manipulate and analyze all sorts of spatial and geographical data.  This program is special because it provides a great alternative for participants to achieve basic or advanced GIS skills specifically tailored to their project needs, outside of a conventional academic-credit program,  says lecturer  Angela Kross , a geospatial technologies specialist who was hired in August 2015 to direct and teach the certificate.  We use geospatial tools such as GPS and Google Maps in our daily activities,  Kross says.  GIS is also a growing domain with more and more professional opportunities that range from data collection to map-making to software development.  The program is designed to offer maximum variability to participants, with two, three and five-day modules.  It s a flexible training setting tailored both to expertise levels and project-specific subject areas,  Kross explains. The idea for the program was born when the department noticed an increased demand for GIS skills training outside of the traditional 13-week theory-intensive course currently offered. In the summer certificate course, participants will learn how to use free GIS open-source software, collect and analyze their data and turn that information into visual representations that will help them effectively communicate. Storytelling is also a curriculum component.  They will learn how to tell stories using online mapping tools,  Kross says. In addition, participants will be exposed to a range of GIS projects led by the department s faculty, as well as by others enrolled in the program.  This will certainly expand the horizons of the participants in terms of what it is possible to achieve with GIS.  Networking opportunities and one-on-one consultations with subject-area specialists who use GIS in their research will be available throughout the program. Kross believes the new program will have broad appeal.  With things like smartphones and GPS devices, GIS is becoming increasingly necessary to many people and professional areas that have not traditionally used it,  she explains. Kross says the program will also hold appeal for those who need it for their research, a work requirement or professional development. Potential participants could include biology students who want to map disease, business students who want to pursue geography-related commercial opportunities and NGO members interested in community mapping.  Any student and professional with the beginning of an idea or a project involving geographic data would certainly benefit from this course.  While the program is just getting started, Kross sees potential for growth.  I am excited about the possibilities,  says Kross.  GIS is a fast-growing area, and with this program we will be able to quickly respond to the specific research and professional development needs of the participants.    The summer Geographic Information Systems (GIS) certification program runs from May 30 to June 3. Space is limited, and participants are encouraged to  sign up now . The cost for students and non-governmental organization (NGO) members is $100 per day, and the regular cost to participants is $375 per day.

On May 2, Canadians began receiving access codes to complete the questionnaire online by May 10. So many people rushed to the Statistics Canada census page that the site went down for 45 minutes . The census collects demographic information on every person in Canada. That data is used by governments, businesses, community organizations and others to make decisions at all levels. One in four households received the 36-page long-form questionnaire. The rest of Canadians will fill out the 10-question version. Both are mandatory. Zachary Patterson , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning, Environment , studies modelling of transportation, the environment, land-use and their linkages.  We asked him about the 2016 census and what it means for our nation.   Should Canadians be excited about this census? Zachary Patterson: Yes, they should. While the 2011 census was consistent and comparable with previous censuses, the National Household Survey was not. The National Household Survey replaced the \"Long form\" of the census. The NHS and Long form of the census collect more detailed information (revenues, ethnic background, employment status, sector of employment, etc.) on households than the census that collects basic information (number of people, ages, genders, etc.). Whereas the Long form of the census (administered to one in five households) was obligatory, the National Household Survey was not. This meant that its results were not comparable with previous information from previous censuses. As a result, this census will be the first time we will have comparable data about many aspects of the lives of Canadians in 10 years. In this digital information-gathering age, is a census still necessary? Doesn't Amazon (for example) have more useful and/or personal information about us? ZP: A census acts as a statistical/socio-demographic ground truth. Without the information provided by a census (i.e. the characteristics of an entire population), it is difficult to put many other types of data in to context   i.e. establish whether they are representative and what they actually represent. If one wants to make inferences about the Canadian population at almost any geographic level (country, province, CMA, census tract) knowledge of the characteristics of the population is necessary. Suppose you wanted to know how many people in the country owned a smartphone. To do this you sampled 1,000 people from across the country. If 800 of those people had a smartphone, how could you estimate how many people in the country had them without knowing the actual population? For the time being, a census is the most practical way to collect such information. There are other alternatives that may in the future be a feasible replacement, but they are fraught with difficulties. Many companies now collect a lot of information on their clients and users. Supposing a smartphone manufacturer collected information on phone owners. First, they probably don't have all information that would typically be collected in a census   they may know (or infer) gender and possibly age, but probably wouldn't know very much about occupation, education, revenue, etc. Second, not everyone has a smartphone, and no smartphone manufacturer makes all smartphones. As a result, it would be difficult to make inferences about the entire population just from smartphone information. It may be possible someday (as is done in some Scandinavian countries) to collect most required census information from existing datasources (e.g. income tax, provincial health insurance, etc.). At the same time, these sources are not necessarily comprehensive (not everyone files taxes), it may be difficult for the federal government to get information from data sources within provincial jurisdiction (e.g. health insurance records). As with the smartphone example above, there is also the problem of missing data. If, for example, people with lower revenues file taxes less, this would provide a distorted picture of revenues. Does census information assist your research and/or teaching at Concordia? If so, then how? ZP: Absolutely. Most of my research in one way or another requires census information. Statistics Canada told the CBC that  May 10 is not a hard deadline for filling out the cenus. However, the government organization is encouraging Canadians to complete the questionnaire as soon as possible in the coming days.

Now she s earned a BSc with Honours in Environmental Science along with the Governor General s Academic Silver Medal, given to the graduating bachelor s-degree-level student with the highest marks.  My goal wasn t to win a medal. My goal was to learn as much as I could learn in order to make the most of my university experience and to do the best that I could do,  says Graham.  It is definitely an honour, but I could never have done it on my own.  She credits the support of people at Concordia, from professors and peers to staff in Counselling and Development, as among those who made her achievement possible. Indeed, she chose the university because it allowed people like her, who d been out of school for a while, to find their feet as independent students and explore options across programs. It was a geography class that ultimately captured her imagination.  I really wanted to learn about how nature works,  says Graham, who switched to the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment.  It is a fascinating program. We learn about water, climate, forestry, geology, ecology, as well as environmental issues associated with each of these.  Her honours research was a global evaluation that will provide conservationists with an estimate of the magnitude of climatic changes that primates will face. This type of analysis hasn t been done before, Graham says.  Tanya is an exceptional student, the best I have ever taught or supervised, and she certainly deserves the recognition,  says Damon Matthews, Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability and an associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment.  She works hard, sets high standards on her work and consequently produces consistent excellent results.  Graham also managed to fit in part-time work at Concordia, facilitating tutorial sessions for an introductory geography course, and to volunteer as a teaching assistant for English as a Second Language classes. She found that helping others refreshed her mentally and spiritually and renewed her energy for her own studies. It was a good lesson in life balance. Graham, who d like to pursue a master s degree, learned some other important lessons during her time at the university:  Don t underestimate yourself and what you are capable of.

Behind the Hingston Hall residences on the Loyola Campus, students are busily working work their way down rows of leafy greens, cutting off the larger leaves an inch above the ground. They pull radishes, pick strawberries, harvest herbs and pluck flowers to use as garnishes; then wash the produce and place it in wicker baskets, ready for sale. Large bags of mixed greens go for $4, and small bags for $3. Radishes cost $1 a bushel.   The workers are all members of City Farm s new eight-month Market Gardener Internship: on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., they sell their produce from a market stand at the school. Any revenue goes first to paying for the seeds and seedlings purchased in the spring   but everything left over is clear profit.    The idea is to get the students thinking about the economics of gardening and farming, especially in a market setting,  City Farm co-coordinator Jackie Martin says.   In March, at the start of the internship, Market Gardeners are divided into four small groups, each with its own plot. Then they are given specific challenges: to grow four plant families; to practise  companion planting,  that is, planting different crops close together to increase productivity; and to build trellises out of discarded materials. They must also let at least one species go to seed so they can collect its seeds at the end of the season.    One student, Josianne Boucher, takes a few moments to show off the plants growing in the packed four-by-five-and-a-half-metre plot tended by her group.  These are our tomatillos,  she says.  It s a Mexican fruit, and you can make salsa verde with it. Those are tomatoes, that s basil, and up there we have eggplants.    She points to a group of plants growing up a trellis constructed out of three old bicycle wheels.  That s a mix of beans and cucumbers. Those are peppers up there in the middle. That s parsley, that s cilantro, kale, and on the other side there is Swiss chard.    It s the first year that City Farm School students have been given their own plots alongside the ones managed by the two City Farm School coordinators, Martin and Marcus Lobb.  They design the whole thing from scratch,  Martin says.  They decide where the rows are going to grow, and what plants they want.    Student Emmalee Biebl washes produce. So far, Martin says, the experiment is working very well.  They make whatever decisions they want. Sometimes they make the same decisions as we do, and sometimes they ll do something totally different. Some stuff they ve done has turned out way better than what we ve done!    As well as the Market Gardener Internship, the school is offering two other new programs this year: a Medicinal Plants Internship, for people who want to learn about growing and using medicinal herbs, and a Schoolyard Gardener Internship, in which interns work alongside five-to-12-year-olds in established gardens at Montreal schools.    All City Farm internships last eight months, starting in March in Concordia s Henry F. Hall Building greenhouse on the Sir George Wlliams Campus and running until the end of the growing season.   For intern Emmalee Biebl, who works as a barber, the Market Stand Internship is a great opportunity to learn about planting and harvesting in an informal setting.  This is the first opportunity I had to do a gardening course, and still work,  she says.  I don t know where this will take me, but it s definitely something I want to do.

Download the free app that could redefine transportation in Montreal Posted on September 13, 2013 | By: Christian Durand Calling all Concordians: Zachary Patterson (right) is using an app to find out how faculty, staff and students commute. Photo by Concordia University One solution may be a few taps of the finger away. Zachary Patterson   a Canada Research Chair and assistant professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment   has developed DataMobile, an origin-destination smartphone app that he hopes will give transit authorities better information on how we move. A former transportation planner with Agence m tropolitaine de transport (AMT), Patterson is calling on students, staff and faculty to use the application between September 16 and October 6. With the data collected, he will look at whether the quality of the information is as reliable as origin-destination surveys conducted over the phone. As city dwellers studying or working on an urban campus, the chaos of traffic-heavy commutes is something many of us have learned to live with. After all, what can we do about it? The DataMobile app is free and available for iPhone and Android devices. Image courtesy of Phil Viau But Patterson says this approach doesn t make more traditional forms of information gathering obsolete. Since mobile data-collection apps are still in their infancy, much remains to be understood about how to interpret and complement the types of information they collect. In fact, the traditional telephone survey remains an integral part of how transportation agencies understand commuting habits. By tapping into smartphone technology, Patterson is taking a big-data approach to origin-destination studies: now that most mobile phones are equipped with GPS, applications like DataMobile are able to capture massive amounts of information quickly and non-invasively.  Cities across North America have to make important decisions when it comes to where to invest in expensive infrastructure projects,  he says.  The richer the data that transport planners have at their disposal, the better informed they will be when it comes to allocating scarce resources.   In Montreal, for example, data gathered through telephone origin-designation surveys   like the one taking place this fall   are being used to evaluate the impact of three subway extensions that are under consideration,  Patterson says.  The last survey cost close to $1.5 million and took three months. This may seem like a lot, but the results serve to evaluate infrastructure investments worth billions of dollars.  And those investments will save us all the continuing frustration and lost time caused by traffic messes. So have your say by downloading the DataMobile app: it s simple, non-invasive and an excellent way of taking part in research that is making a difference. However   if the phone rings and you don t recognize the number, answer it. Patterson says it could very well be the AMT calling.  Your input will literally shape the future of transportation networks.  How it works Access the App Store or Google Play Store and download DataMobile for free. Launch the application and fill out a two-minute survey. Let the application run in the background for a maximum of two weeks. Wait to see if you win an iPad 2.

Uniquely, it also assigns a temperature-change value to each country that reflects its contribution to observed global warming. The study was conducted at Concordia under the leadership of Damon Matthews, an associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment. In a straight ranking, the U.S. is an unambiguous leader, responsible for a global temperature increase of 0.15 C. That s close to 20 per cent of the observed warming. China and Russia account for around eight per cent each; Brazil and India seven per cent; and Germany and the U.K. around five per cent each. Canada comes in tenth place, right after France and Indonesia. Although it may seem surprising that less industrialized countries, including Brazil and Indonesia, ranked so highly, their positions reflect carbon dioxide emissions related to deforestation. In the study, the research team used a new methodology to calculate national contributions to global warming. It weighted each type of emission according to the atmospheric lifetime of the temperature change it caused. Using data from 1750 onward, the team accounted for carbon dioxide contributions from fossil fuel burning and land-use change, along with methane, nitrous oxide and sulphate aerosol emissions. Matthews and his colleagues also experimented with scaling the emissions to the size of the corresponding area (see graphic above). Western Europe, the U.S., Japan and India are hugely expanded, reflecting emissions much greater than would be expected based on their geographic area. Russia, China and Brazil stay the same. Taken in this light, the climate contributions of Brazil and China don t seem so out of line   they are perfectly proportionate to the countries  land masses. Canada and Australia become stick thin as their land mass is much larger than their share of the global-warming pie. Meanwhile, dividing each country s climate contribution by its population paints a different picture. Amongst the 20 largest total emitters, the top seven per capita positions are occupied by developed countries, with Canada falling in third place behind the U.K. and the U.S. In this ranking, China and India drop to the bottom of the list. Matthews s study highlights how much individual countries have contributed to the climate problem, as well as the huge disparity between rich and poor with respect to per-person contributions to global warming. Acknowledging these disparities, and then moving to correct them, may be a fundamental requirement for success in efforts to decrease global greenhouse-gas emissions. * Parts of this text appear courtesy of New Scientist magazine.

Freak snowstorms. Devastating tsunamis. Polar vortexes. The Earth s climate is undeniably becoming increasingly volatile. A number of professors and students from Concordia s four academic faculties are examining the effects of climate change and looking for ways to sustain human activities without depleting the Earth s resources. Their research and teaching are serving as scientific warnings, opening up exciting new opportunities revolving around sustainability and deepening human understanding and awareness. We present a few of their efforts. Skating on thin ice Damon Matthews is an associate professor in Concordia s department of geography, planning and environment. He says it s not too late to stop the rise of the earth s temperature   and the decline of outdoor ice hockey   but it would require  prompt and significant action.  When Damon Matthews co-published a 2012 paper warning that the days of Canada s outdoor skating rinks could be numbered, the associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment received more media atten tion than he ever had before. Hockey in Canada is, after all, sacred.  Based on the conditions needed to create outdoor rinks and what we ve observed from the meteorological data over the previous 30 years, we extrapolated that we have about three more decades of viable outdoor skating,  Matthews says.  That really touched a cultural nerve among Canadians that I hope will help lead to significant action in terms of reducing carbon emissions.  Matthews uses mathematical calcula tions to model climate response to carbon dioxide (CO2) and other emissions.  The ratio is a 1.5-degree-Celsius-higher global temperature for every trillion tonnes of carbon emitted into our atmosphere,  he explains.  And while it took us 200 years to emit a half-trillion tonnes, it will take us only 50 years to emit another half-tril lion at current levels.  With carbon emissions still increasing, that additional 500 billion tonnes might occur even sooner, he adds. The only way to stop the planet from warming further is to stop emissions im mediately.  Of course, zero emissions are unlikely to happen overnight because people won t decommission current production and transportation systems or change their habits that quickly,  Matthews says. Matthews and his Concordia colleagues have therefore looked at the amount of emissions already embedded into the cur rent fossil fuel infrastructure to determine the amount of  wiggle room  to stabilize the increase in the Earth s overall temper ature to only 2 degrees Celsius.  If we want global warming to stay below 2 degrees Celsius, we need to cut all emissions by at least half,  he says. Given this reality, some researchers are proposing to remove CO2 from the atmosphere to keep global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.  That s when people start talking about geo-engineering projects, such as artificial trees to suck CO2 from the atmosphere,  Matthews says. He s conducting simulations to de termine how the climate might respond to some of the proposed technological solutions.  For instance, one idea is to spray reflective particles into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight,  Matthews says.  However, that would introduce a whole other suite of potential side effects on the climate system, such as impacts on the ozone layer and changes in rainfall patterns.  His modelling indicates that reaching zero emissions as soon as possible through renewable energy sources and significant changes in our lifestyle and habitat remains the best solution. To show what needs to be done, one of his recent projects involved calculating the historical emissions produced by nations and how each country s emissions are contributing to the global tempera ture increase.  Of course, the United States produces the most emissions, and Canada ranked 10th, which is not very good given its relatively small popula tion,  he says.  We re hoping this kind of information will spur governments to action.  There s a misconception that even if we stopped emitting carbon, the Earth s temperature would continue to rise, and that s not the case,  he emphasizes.  We could stabilize the planet s temperature if we take prompt and significant ac tion.  It s why Matthews conducts studies that alert people to the fact that if carbon emissions aren t dramatically curbed without delay, other young boys and girls might not have the chance to learn hockey on an outdoor rink like Wayne Gretzky did. If carbon emissions aren t dramatically curbed without delay, other young boys and girls might not have the chance to learn hockey on an outdoor rink like Wayne Gretzky did, Raising awareness through art Ricardo Dal Farra, an associate professor in the Department of Music, has worked on several balance-unbalance conferences. balance-unbalance merges art and issues of sustainability. Research in the fine arts has a less obvious connection to sustainability than that of other disciplines   but Ricardo Dal Farra, an associate professor in the Department of Music, is helping change that perception. Dal Farra has been a leading organizer of three international BALANCE-UNBALANCE conferences that have brought artists together with scientists, engineers, sociologists, policymakers and others to help resolve the world s pressing environmental issues. BALANCE-UNBALANCE 2011 involved the collaboration of colleagues from Concordia s departments of Geography, Planning and Environment, Political Science, Design and Computation Arts, Communication Studies and Music, as well as the David O Brien Centre for Sustainable Enterprise. The highly successful 2013 BALANCE-UNBALANCE conference was held at the UNESCO-designated Noosa Biosphere in Queensland, Australia. It prompted the Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre to approach Dal Farra about creating some original music to play during their presentations and workshops, as well as games that the organization uses to help government officials and other key people to understand the complexities of disaster risk management. Dal Farra suggested a contest to find original music and sound-art works for the climate centre s overall humanitarian responses to people dealing with floods, drought and other disasters related to climate change.  Pablo Suarez, the centre s associate director for Research and Innovation, was so pleased that he asked if we could also launch a contest for music miniatures specifically for the efforts to obtain mosquito nets to prevent dengue fever,  Dal Farra says. The contests have been a springboard for the  art!   climate  project, which aims to use art as a catalyst for social awareness and change.  To compose a piece about climate change or dengue fever, you really have to understand what the problem is, so the contest rules prompted entrants to read white papers and other documents about climate change and its consequences,  Dal Farra says.  The contests encouraged sound artists to reflect significantly on the situation and what kind of message they wanted to get across.  A jury of highly regarded composers and media artists chose 39 submissions as being of very good quality from among the large number received. The climate centre selected nine compositions for its purposes. Dal Farra and the other contest organizers are programming many of the remaining high-quality pieces into conferences and festivals related to climate change around the world.  We re also in the process of putting all the pieces on a website  with a Creative Commons licence that gives organizations and individuals the permission to download and use them in connection with any initiatives specifically related to dealing with climate change,  he says. The response and outcome of the initial contests were so successful that the  art!   climate  project and BALANCE-UNBALANCE conference series were featured in the April 2013 issue of Leonardo   Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology.  We really have shown how art can play a fundamental role in social change,  Dal Farra says.  It s a message that I keep emphasizing to my students by integrating issues related to climate change in my teaching and making them a part of the curriculum activities for my composition of electroacoustic music classes.   We really have shown how art can play a fundamental role in social change,  Dal Farra says. Creating new value from old goods Department of Marketing associate professor Zeynep Arsel s research includes looking at  upcycling,  the process of taking someone else s trash and turning it into something of value. A lamp from the 1980s may be nothing but junk to a lot of us. Yet some people would love to get their hands on one. It s this kind of unprecedented value for items that Zeynep Arsel, an associate professor in the Department of Marketing at the John Molson School of Business (JMSB), is researching as a consumption scholar. She s looking at how people s evolving ideas of what holds value might help to save the planet s resources.  I am increasingly seeing people desire items in ways that were unimaginable in the past,  Arsel says.  And I m examining how that desire could help to avoid resource depletion in the long run.  Arsel s research is focused on how people are creating value by trading items that wouldn t otherwise be marketable.  This includes exchanging unsellable items, such as used makeup,  she notes. Her current project involves examining various forms of exchange within Canada and the United States that exist outside the formal marketplace, such as bartering.  I m investigating how people are creating and maintaining systems that I would say make up for the limitations of the formal marketplace,  she explains. She is also looking at upcycling   the process of using what would otherwise become trash to create new items, such as leather bags from worn jackets.  People are really starting to recognize the dormant value of the items in their closets and cupboards and putting that into action,  she says.  I m researching this in terms of the concept of value which I think needs to be re-theorized in light of these relatively new activities.  The growing popularity of the Freecycle Network , which claims nearly eight million participants around the world, provides another example. The site helps individuals to pass along and receive items for free.  People are using the site to give things away because they realize the value in creating more space for themselves, or they want to increase their moral capital by helping others in the process of facilitating the reuse of items rather than just discarding them,  Arsel says.  I think there may be a real con sciousness-awakening here.  Arsel is noticing that as some are becoming more aware of the dormant value in used and upcycled items, they are creating formal marketplaces for them. Entrepreneurs are establishing upcycling businesses. Organizations are opening thrift shops to raise money for medical research or charitable efforts. For now, Arsel is focusing on value that isn t determined by a monetary amount.  I m more interested in floating value,  she says.  What is it that makes  people decide that a used object is worth something? What is it that makes some of us seek out items that others consider junk or garbage? What determines a fair exchange? How is it that a book could end up being a fair trade for a chair?  Arsel has received a wide array of answers so far, which is making it a real challenge to establish some kind of shared criteria.  It s very subjective,  she emphasizes.  What s interesting is that people are not just exchanging physical items in many cases, but objects that come with stories that form part of their value structure.  As more networks for bartering or swapping become established, Arsel suspects that society s mainstream notions of value might also keep shifting. She speculates:  Fixed currencies might become less important in determining exchanges.  Arsel s research is focused on how people are creating value by trading items that wouldn t otherwise be marketable.  This includes exchanging unsellable items, such as used makeup,  she notes.

Concordia research shows which countries are most responsible for the cost of environmental damage from global warming Posted on September 8, 2015 | By: Cl a Desjardins All countries have contributed to recent climate change, but some much more so than others. Those that have contributed more than their fair share have accumulated a climate debt, owed to countries that have contributed less to historical warming. This is the implication of a new study published in Nature Climate Change, in which Concordia University researcher Damon Matthews shows how national carbon and climate debts could be used to decide who should pay for the global costs of climate mitigation and damages. The countries that have accumulated the largest carbon debts on account of higher than average per-capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. The U.S. alone carries 40 per cent of the cumulative world debt, while Canada carries about four per cent. On the other side, the carbon creditors   those whose share of CO2 emissions has been smaller than their share of world population   are India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, Brazil and China, with India holding 30 per cent of the total world credit.   Thinking of climate change in terms of debts and credits for individual countries shows how much countries have over- or under-contributed to historical warming, relative to their proportion of the world s population over time,  explains Matthews, study author and associate professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment.  This paints a striking picture of the historical inequalities among countries with respect to their greenhouse gas emissions and consequent responsibility for climate changes.  Calculating climate responsibility To estimate differences in national responsibility for historical climate changes, Matthews first calculated carbon debts and credits based on fossil fuel CO2 emission and population records since 1990. It was around this date that scientific knowledge and public understanding of the dangers of human-driven climate changes began to solidify. Since that time, the total carbon debt across all debtor nations has increased to 250 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. And it s still going up: the increase in world carbon debt in 2013 alone was 13 billion tonnes, or about 35 per cent of global CO2 emissions in that year. So what is the monetary value of this debt?  According to a recent U.S. government report, the current best estimate of the social cost of present-day CO2 emissions is about $40 USD per tonne of CO2,  says Matthews.  Multiply $40 by the 13 billion tonnes of carbon debt accrued in 2013, and you get $520 billion. This cost estimate gives us an indication of how much we could be paying to help lower-emitting countries cope with the costs of climate changes, or develop their economies along carbon-free pathways.  Looking at the total world carbon debt, the numbers are even more staggering: the 250 billion tonnes of debt accumulated since 1990, at $40 per tonne, represents $10 trillion USD.  No matter how you look at this picture, these numbers are really big   much, much larger than even the most generous financial commitments currently pledged by countries to help with the cost of climate adaptation and damages in vulnerable countries.  CO2 emissions vs. degrees of debt Matthews also calculated how much each country has over- or under-contributed to temperature increases as a result of a range of different greenhouse gas emissions. By this measure, the total accumulated world climate debt comes to 0.1 C since 1990, close to a third of observed warming over this period of time. Again the U.S. is the single largest debtor, and India is the largest creditor. Some countries, however, like Brazil and Indonesia, switch from being carbon creditors, to being among the climate debtor countries, as a result of the additional greenhouse gas emissions produced by deforestation and agriculture.  This idea of climate and carbon debts and credits highlight the large historical inequalities with respect to how much individual countries have contributed to climate warming,  says Matthews.  The historical debts and credits calculated here could be a helpful tool to inform policy discussions relating to historical responsibility and burden sharing, by providing a measure of who should pay  and how much they might be expected to pay   for the costs of mitigation and climate damages in countries with lower emissions.  What does this mean for the upcoming Paris meetings? As countries continue to announce their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (or INDCs) leading up to December s climate talks in Paris, it is becoming increasingly clear that these emissions pledges will not be enough to meet the international goal of limiting global warming to 2 C (see related research by Matthews  research group published last month in Environmental Research Letters ). The idea of additionally accounting for debts and credits would of course increase the burden placed on countries with high historical emissions.  But these historical inequalities are real and substantial, and need to be fully acknowledged,  says Matthews.  My hope is that this discussion will help lead to a stronger and more meaningful global climate agreement.    Find out more about research in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment .

As vice president of the Freshwater program at World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF-Canada), Snider is overseeing the first centralized database of Canadian freshwater and its biggest threats. WWF-Canada recently rolled out the benchmarking project Watershed Reports: Taking the Pulse of Canada s Rivers. The interactive website provides a timely assessment of Canada s 25 major watersheds   the interconnected rivers, wetlands and lakes that drain into a common body of water. The World Wildlife Fund's Watershed Reports is an online tool that reports the health of Canada's water systems. | Courtesy: World Wildlife Fund The user-friendly tool aims to convey information clearly, for all to understand. It appeals to scientists, recreational outdoor enthusiasts and even schoolchildren. It shows completed assessments for half of Canada s watersheds and WWF-Canada estimates it will complete the remainder by 2017. Watershed Reports assesses the health of a water system based on water flow, water quality, bugs and fish. Seven criteria are used to rank threats: pollution, climate change, overuse of water, alteration of flows, invasive species and habitat loss and fragmentation. Concordia experience paved the way Snider says his graduate diploma in environmental assessment helped prepare him for his role as the project s leader. James Snider, GrDip 07, leads the WWF-Canada Watershed Reports project.  At Concordia I was lucky to get a nature conservation internship, because that served as my bridge into the not-for-profit environmental sector,  he says.  I learned hard skills and soft skills that landed me a job with WWF six months after graduating.  A teacher s assistant while at Concordia, Snider started out at WWF-Canada as a data-crunching geographic information system analyst. Now he supervises a Canada-wide team of specialists from WWF-Canada headquarters in Toronto. Although he considers himself more of a technician than a science communicator, he engages with different types of organizations, from conservation groups to government monitoring programs.  I m involved in projects at various levels across the country,  Snider says.  They pave the way for community programs and data collection to take place.  Canadians taking responsibility for water systems Recently the conservation sector has been focusing on empowering individuals and groups to help with large-scale projects such as Watershed Reports.  We re formatting a network approach,  Snider explains. He points to the importance of cross-organizational collaboration.  Citizen scientists, community groups, recreational campers and manufacturing plants all have a role to play in nature conservation.  The report s strong foundation of data will make it easier for advocacy organizations to inform high-level decision makers in policy and best-business practices. The goal is to have all of Canada s watersheds rated as  good condition  by 2025   although most of the watersheds assessed so far show concerning threat levels. Watershed Reports challenges Canadians to act. Its interactive map also displays volunteering and clean-up opportunities.  We want to see a broad audience log on to Watershed Reports, from a family of recreational campers to a construction company CEO,  Snider says.  Ultimately, we hope to provide better local water management from a national online platform.  #CUalumni ","title":"Fresh information on Canadian freshwater"},{"url":"https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/geography-planning-environment/news/archive/cunews/main/stories/2015/10/07/why-canada-needs-to-transition-to-a-low-carbon-economy-and-how.html","body":"A low-carbon economy 'for a future that's worthwhile' On October 15, climate-change crusader Catherine Potvin brings her message to Concordia Posted on October 7, 2015 | By: Elisabeth Faure  We want a plan to meet the target, and currently Canada does not have one   there s a target with no plan.\" A group of experts says Canada needs to act now to reduce carbon emissions, or the next generation of citizens will live in a world defined by extreme climate warming. In the final countdown to the federal election, and in advance of the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference , the Sustainable Canada Dialogues (SCD) research project is challenging Canadians and political leaders to step up their environmental game. The initiative s goal? To begin Canada s transition to a low-carbon economy. Catherine Potvin, a forest ecologist and the 2012 winner of the Royal Society of Canada s Miroslaw Romanowski Medal for scientific work relating to environmental problems, has been spearheading the SCD research project for three years. On Thursday, October 15, Concordia s Science College will host the McGill Biology professor, who holds the Canada Research Chair on Climate Change Mitigation and Tropical Forests, as part of its public lecture series. Potvin's lecture,  Acting on Climate Change: Mobilizing Society to Find Solutions,  will summarize the results of the SCD consultations, during which the group spoke to more than 60 researchers from all ten provinces. The researchers, representing fields ranging from engineering to business to philosophy, were asked to come up with solutions that will allow Canada to begin its transition to a low-carbon economy. The group has put forward 10 key recommendations. Chief among them is a national tax on carbon.  We think this is a fundamental one, you can consider it the floor under our feet,  says Potvin. The price of carbon would be identical across all the provinces, something most political parties have been reluctant to endorse thus far in the election. SCD wants to see low-carbon electricity across Canada, a goal Potvin says can be achieved by 2035. The group is also calling for this kind of power to become Canada s major source of energy for buildings, transportation and industry. Although some might consider them lofty, Potvin says these targets are possible to reach, adding that in her cross-country presentations to unions, First Nations groups and industry representatives, the goals were met enthusiastically.  When we launched this document, many people were quite pessimistic, and thinking we would have no traction,  says Potvin.  I ended up giving interviews coast to coast   and I was always met with the same comment:  Hey, Professor. What you re suggesting makes a lot of sense. Why aren t we doing it?  On the political side, SCD is trying to draw attention to what different parties are promising in advance of the October 19 election. Damon Matthews , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability, contributed to Potvin s project to analyze political parties  climate platforms.  SCD is a very impressive effort to bring such a diverse group of academics together to envision a more sustainable Canada.  Potvin calls Canada s current carbon-reduction program a  smokescreen.   What we want is a plan to meet the target, and currently Canada does not have one   there s a target with no plan,  she says. It s something SCD hopes will change with the next government. Beyond political or scientific concerns, Potvin has a personal desire to see the project succeed.  I have a granddaughter, and two grandsons,  she says.  It s my way of doing what I can to ensure that they have a future that is worthwhile.

This op-ed was recently published in the Montreal Gazette . Reading the Leap Manifesto was a startling and inspiring experience. Launched on September 15 by Naomi Klein and an impressive list of signatories , the Leap presents a remarkable vision of change that is both necessary and possible to achieve. In a political climate where climate change has been all but forgotten, reading such a clear and compelling call to abandon fossil fuel energy sources within the next few decades was like waking from a bad dream. I have worked as a climate scientist and researcher for more than a decade. I and others have shown how each emission of carbon dioxide leads to a discrete and essentially irreversible increase in world temperatures. We have shown that a zero-carbon emissions target is the only one that will stabilize global temperatures, and that the world therefore has a finite carbon budget that we must not exceed if we want to stabilize at an increase of 2 C or any other level. We have calculated how small this carbon budget actually is   something like three decades  worth of current emissions   and shown just how far the current national emissions pledges are from meeting the 2 C target. And I have worked with friends and colleagues to show how current investments in fossil fuel infrastructure commit us to decades of continued emissions and climate warming. I understand just how difficult it will be to limit emissions to a level that will prevent dangerous climate changes. I understand also that another degree of global warming will not be pleasant for much of the world, and will very likely be dangerous for the rest. Here in Canada, we could lose the ability to play hockey outdoors in the winter; but this pales in comparison to the potential for widespread loss of coral reefs, or sea-level rise that threatens low-lying island countries. A 2 C world will be a different and more dangerous one. But a 3 C world will be much more dangerous, and a 4 C world possibly catastrophic. So fossil fuels will not be the energy source of this future world. There is really no other alternative. This is why the vision of the Leap Manifesto is so compelling. The call for a dramatic and rapid transition to an economy fuelled by renewable energy is exactly what is necessary, and what is consistent with the science of global warming. But the Leap Manifesto is also a clear statement that it is possible to define a better world. And this is where its real power lies. For too long now, the demands of limiting global warming to 2 C have been seen as too high, too hard and too expensive. As a country and as an international community, we have stopped believing that we can meet the challenge of climate change. Why have we lost this belief? For more than two decades, the need to act to stop driving global temperatures upwards has been clear and supported by solid scientific evidence. But for every scientific step forward, there has been an onslaught of denial telling us to doubt both the reality and the severity of global warming. It is no surprise that we would come to doubt also our ability to rise to the climate challenge. Humanity is capable of pulling off dramatic and rapid change. Tipping points are possible and once crossed can take us quickly to new ways of living that do not depend on carbon-intensive energy. We can build a new and more just global society in time to avoid the most dangerous outcomes. But fundamentally, we have to believe that this is possible. In short, we can Leap.

The World Science Forum has convened every two years since 2001, in an effort to bring together leading scientists, international science organizations, science advisors and political decision makers. The goal of this year s forum, held last week in Budapest, was to promote the  Enabling Power of Science  by highlighting the role and potential of science to inform solutions to current global challenges. One important set of global challenges is articulated in the  Sustainable Development Goals,  which were ratified by the United Nations in September of this year. There are 17 global goals, which cover development priorities such as decreasing world poverty and hunger, improving access to water, health services and sustainable energy, addressing gender and other inequalities, promoting environmental protection, and encouraging action on climate change. Breaking silos A common theme of the discussions and presentations in Budapest was the interconnection between these goals and their many individual targets, and the need to break silos and stimulate collaboration across disciplines to generate innovative solutions.  As a climate scientist, I came to the World Science Forum with an interest in learning about how climate change science could contribute to global sustainability and development challenges. Climate change will likely have its most serious and dangerous consequences in developing countries. These impacts will exacerbate existing challenges, and in the long term could compromise our ability to achieve many of the sustainable development goals. But the details of these interactions between changes and other sustainability targets are complex and not well understood; the ways that changing patterns of rainfall, extreme weather and high temperatures could affect poverty, inequality, food and water security, health, migration, conflict, access to energy and overall economic development remain highly uncertain, and in some cases largely unknown. There is considerable potential for silo-breaking trans-disciplinary research to shed light on these questions. Climate action and sustainable development In the opening plenary of the conference, I was therefore quite dismayed to hear the idea of climate action dismissed as being an ineffective way to address global sustainability challenges, and a low priority compared to other more urgent needs. Bjorn Lomborg, president and founder of the Copenhagen Consensus Center , argued that investments in climate action would detract from potential investments in other development challenges such as poverty alleviation or improvements in health services. The clear implication of his argument was that we need to emphasize action on development priorities by using the most cost-effective strategies currently available to us, without worrying too much about the effects of these strategies on development s climate footprint. Lomborg s argument was a clear example of thinking that did not acknowledge the interactions between climate and sustainable development, nor the potentially very severe long-term climate impacts on the most vulnerable human societies. The magnitude of the climate challenge   that we need to eliminate the global use of fossil fuels within the next half-century   requires immediate action on decarbonization in developed countries, in addition to the mobilization of a tremendous amount of financial resources to assist with the development of sustainable energy technologies in the world s poorest countries. Of course there are urgent development needs that could be met now without addressing climate change; but to use this as an argument to dismiss climate action altogether is to trade off the future to meet the needs of the present generation. This is fundamentally at odds with the very essence of sustainable development. A lack of real engagement There were other, more progressive perspectives offered by other speakers in other sessions of the conference, and the declaration produced by the conference organizers did include a clear call to action on both climate change and the sustainable development goals. But I remained struck by a lack of real engagement between the climate research community and the discussion of what is needed to meet the very real and pressing needs of low- and middle-income countries. I think there is a real need to fill this gap, and to engage more actively on questions of how climate change research can be used to motivate and inform not just action on climate change, but also the ways that we seek to address other sustainable development goals. World Science Forum 2017 At the closing ceremony in Budapest, we were addressed by Princess Sumaya bint El Hassan of the royal family of Jordan, who will be hosting the next World Science Forum in 2017. She gave a remarkable speech, one that managed to be both critical and empowering in equal measure, and I was left feeling both inspired and excited to see what new ideas and perspectives would be brought to this next meeting. But one message from her address in particular resonated with me: that the most potent threat to global sustainability is short-term thinking.

That s the question driving the fifth edition of the Montr al Summit on Innovation (SMI 2015) taking place on Monday, November 30, at the Palais des congr s de Montr al . The conference was organized by the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, while Concordia set this year s theme, Climate (of) Change: Cities, People and Prosperity, and staff and faculty from the Office of Research developed the programming. Academics, decision makers and scientists will address the anticipated repercussions of climate change, as well as review exemplary practices in the areas of risk management strategy, investment and urban planning and social innovation. Alan Shepard , Concordia s president, will provide opening remarks, and 16 experts in their respective fields will lead sessions. David Suzuki is speaking in the early evening, as part of the Bell International Leaders series. Climate change:  also a huge business opportunity  The relationship between population growth and climate is a hot conference topic.  Adding 2.5 billion to urban populations by 2050, which is the projection, means building 2,500 cities of one million people each, within 35 years,  says conference speaker Paul Shrivastava , executive director of Concordia s Future Earth and the David O'Brien Distinguished Professor of Sustainable Enterprise at Concordia's John Molson School of Business .  Climate change will impact this rapid urbanization, and urbanization will impact climate. This is both a huge threat and also a huge business opportunity.  Shrivastava stresses that building the necessary urban infrastructure to house future generations will require good trans-disciplinary scientific understanding of the challenges, and visionary business and political leadership. A fully decarbonized economy The conference will include a scientific overview of the history of climate change by Damon Matthews , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability.  Climate action has been an international priority for more than 25 years and we ve delayed far too long,  says Matthews.  It is critical that we set a course now toward a fully decarbonized economy.   The magnitude of the climate challenge is staggering. We need to be off fossil fuels within half a century, and this will require action and innovation in every sector of our society. Here in Canada, our energy-policy decisions have been at direct odds with the priorities of climate action. The time has come to align our national energy policies with this new reality.\" In response to the serious nature of environmental warnings, the conference will conclude with a presentation of examples of innovative commercial, social and technological initiatives to deal with climate change. A challenge for humanity  The battle for climate change is, and will be, a challenge for humanity,  says Damien Sil s, executive director of Quartier de l innovation.  There s no plan B. The SMI is the Canadian forum on this subject in 2015, offering a foundation for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) this year.  Sil s is impressed with the conference lineup.  We ve attracted world-renowned speakers, and we hope to sensitize politicians and the business community to the major impact of the actual climate upheaval.   Now we re moving into action  Michel Leblanc, president and chief executive officer of the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, says he s pleased to be taking part in organizing the Montreal Summit on Innovation for the second year.  In the past, efforts went into raising awareness about climate change. Now we are moving into action,  he says.  Greenhouse gas emissions targets and the investments announced in Qu bec s Green Fund will create business opportunities. The Montreal Summit on Innovation will spotlight these opportunities, along with the economic impact of climate change on Montreal and all of Quebec.  Students must register by phone, and their tickets are $85. Adult tickets are between $275 and $350. Admission to David Suzuki s talk starts at $35.

And today, November 18, is Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Day ,  recognized internationally as an opportunity for GIS users to demonstrate how the technology is being used to make a difference in our society.  What better occasion to announce a new agreement between Quebec s universities and the Minist re de l nergie et des ressources naturelles (MERN) that provides unprecedented access to a wide range of geospatial data products? The agreement, negotiated by the Bureau de coop ration interuniversitaire (BCI), means that a large trove of government information  road and address networks, topographic maps, cadastral and LIDAR data, and orthophotos (geometrically corrected aerial images)  will now be readily available to researchers at the province s post-secondary institutions.  Big data has become crucial to answering large questions facing society,  says Concordia s university librarian Guylaine Beaudry, who participated in the negotiations along with geospatial and data services librarian Alex Guindon.  By increasing access to almost all geospatial data produced by the Quebec government, this agreement will make it easier to advance research and scholarship in Quebec,  says Beaudry. Geospatial data is anything that identifies geographical features and boundaries on the planet. This includes the coordinates and topology of natural structures, construction projects, oceans and more. It s often assessed, manipulated or analyzed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Guindon says the use of GIS across disciplines is booming.  So, anyone who may need to look at aerial photos, elevation data, road networks and detailed topographic maps will benefit tremendously from these newly available datasets.  Andr  Roy, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science , says the announcement is great news for students and researchers across numerous departments.  It will enhance our ability to represent, understand and solve a wide range of problems related to the environment and to our society.  Some of the newly available datasets cover the whole province of Quebec, and the resolution is superior to what was previously available from the federal government. Pascale Biron from the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment says this is important, because students who may have previously chosen to focus their research on other areas, including the United States  for which geospatial data was more readily available   will now be more likely to conduct their projects locally.  It s an opportunity for everyone to get to know their environment a bit better, and it's only positive to make sure that such data are available,  she says. Discussions with the government were a collective process, involving major contributions from colleagues from other universities. With the support of researchers, both librarians and civil servants at MERN worked together towards the common goal of improving access to geospatial data. For her part, Beaudry says she s proud of the role played by the province s university library system in supporting access to geospatial data. She adds that, for Concordia, the initiative fits in well with the new strategic directions .   By improving our local and global understandings of populations, places and communities, this new agreement contributes to the conditions that will help us double our research and teach for tomorrow.

The conference will include a scientific overview of the history of climate change by  Damon Matthews , associate professor in the  Department of Geography, Planning and Environment  and Concordia University Research Chair in Climate Science and Sustainability. Matthews  runs the  Concordia Climate Science, Impacts and Mitigation Studies (C2SIMS) Lab , which aims to improve our understanding of the science of climate change, its impacts on human and environmental systems, and address how best to mitigate human disruption of the climate.  Daniel Horen Greenford One example of the kind of research underway in the lab is Daniel Horen Greenford s ongoing Master s thesis project, in which he s attempting to calculate national contributions to climate change using his own formalizations of emissions accounting. If real change is to occur, says Horen Greenford, leaders and experts need to learn from the mistakes of past global initiatives. Horen Greenford uses the example of the Kyoto Protocol as a climate policy that hurt more than it helped. It allowed manufacturing to be displaced to non-signatory countries whose factories pollute more per unit than those in the developed nations where production originated. The phenomenon is known as  carbon leakage,  and it has caused a net increase in global emissions. At the same time, developed nations are able to congratulate themselves on meeting their reduction targets.   This standard has allowed wealthy nations to dislocate their emissions in order to meet their reduction targets while global emissions still rise,  Horen explains.  It s like a high school bully forcing another kid to hide contraband when the teacher checks his bag.  A different way of tracking emissions To tackle this issue, Horen Greenford is developing a new accounting method that effectively captures the effects of trade and allocates emissions embodied in goods to trading partners in a fair way. The model weighs emissions according to their economic benefit, using a definition of utility rooted in ethical considerations of necessity, while respecting geographical circumstances and cultural plurality. The production of goods is weighted in accordance with their utility. Essential items have the highest levels of utility while luxury items have the lowest. Weighting penalizes nations less for consuming goods that are more useful and holds populations more responsible for items they consume that are not necessary for survival. For example, a region that has a lot of cars should assume responsibility for the emissions used in the production of their vehicles in other countries, especially when producing regions do not have high car-ownership rates.  We must provide an account of emissions that better captures responsibility for emissions and can be used to hold nations accountable accordingly in international policy agreements,  says Horen Greenford.  This boils down to how we tabulate national inventories. By including emissions embodied in traded goods into national inventories, a better case can be made for bringing more countries to the negotiating table   one that is more robust and has greater considerations of equity.  Facing climate change in our city This model could also be used at the municipal level, too, says Horen Greenford. An urban inventory of all goods and services imported and exported could be traced across the supply chain to give cities a sense of their global impact on greenhouse gas emissions.  Here in Montreal, figuring out how we are impacting climate change would help policy and inform businesses and governments to make better choices when it comes to urban planning and infrastructure investment.

This op-ed was  recently published in the Montreal Gazette . With the adoption of the Paris Agreement , the world has finally struck a deal to fight climate change. The goal  to hold temperatures to  well below 2  C  and pursue  efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5  C   is impressively ambitious. If we can achieve this, we stand a good chance of avoiding some truly dangerous climate impacts. On the other hand, the Paris Agreement does not include mechanisms to compel countries to act, and countries  current emissions commitments will not be enough to achieve the agreement s temperature goal. The success or failure of the Paris Agreement will therefore depend entirely on the collective actions of all nations in the years to come. And achieving the 2 C target let alone 1.5 C  will require strong action on every front. The Paris Agreement states that countries should seek to  reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible   and to undertake rapid reductions   so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century.  This is unfortunately not the clearest of statements. So here is what it actually means: To stabilize global temperatures at any level, we need to stop adding carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Net emissions from human activity must eventually reach zero, such that any continued emissions are balanced by an equivalent amount of intentional removal from the atmosphere. To meet the 2 C goal, this net-zero target must be reached by the year 2070. To stay below 1.5 C, we have to hit net-zero by closer to 2050. Meeting the 2 C target will be hard. Staying below 1.5 C will be even harder. Impossible? Only if we don t try hard enough. Encouragingly, there is now some evidence of progress. According to new emissions data from the Global Carbon Project published last week in Nature Climate Change, global CO2 emissions have been stable since 2013. Emissions from 2013-2014 increased by only 0.6 per cent (compared to 2.5 per cent increases in previous years), and emissions in 2015 may have actually decreased back to 2013 levels. This is the result of decreased coal use in China coupled with rapid global growth of non-fossil energy sources, and marks the first time that emissions have not increased during a time of global economic expansion. It may be that a  global peaking  of CO2 emissions has occurred sooner than we dared to imagine possible. And if nations take up the challenge of the Paris Agreement, this might even be enough to move us further along a decreasing emissions trajectory. Canada has an opportunity to step up and lead this global effort. According to researchers at Stanford University, Canada could transition to 100 per cent renewable energy sources by 2050, using a combination of wind, solar and hydro power. This is the bar we have to set for ourselves. We have both the responsibility and the ability to act to cut our emissions more quickly than the rest of the world. It is therefore essential that the target of eventual net-zero emissions be internalized at every level of decision-making. New energy infrastructure needs to be carbon-free, and existing fossil fuel energy infrastructure needs to be either decommissioned or retrofitted with carbon capture technology. New buildings should be built to be powered by renewable energy technology, and existing buildings retrofitted with new energy technologies. New vehicles should be built without internal combustion engines, and existing gasoline-powered vehicles phased out. None of this is impossible. It is just a question of making the right choices. We need to realize and acknowledge that every greenhouse gas emission that we produce takes us incrementally closer to the level of climate change we need to avoid. We need to spend our remaining carbon budget with the utmost reticence and care. The Paris Agreement tells us where we need to go, but it will be up to us to choose the path that will take us there.

But what does that mean locally? A new study published in Nature Climate Change pinpoints the temperature increases caused by CO 2 emissions in different regions around the world. Using simulation results from 12 global climate models, Damon Matthews , a professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment , along with post-doctoral researcher Martin Leduc, produced a map that shows how the climate changes in response to cumulative carbon emissions around the world. They found that temperature increases in most parts of the world respond linearly to cumulative emissions.  This provides a simple and powerful link between total global emissions of carbon dioxide and local climate warming,  says Matthews.  This approach can be used to show how much human emissions are to blame for local changes.  Leduc and Matthews, along with co-author Ramo n de Eli a from Ouranos , a Montreal-based consortium on regional climatology, analyzed the results of simulations in which CO2 emissions caused the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to increase by 1 per cent each year until it reached four times the levels recorded prior to the Industrial Revolution. Globally, the researchers saw an average temperature increase of 1.7  0.4 C per trillion tonnes of carbon in CO2 emissions (TtC), which is consistent with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . But the scientists went beyond these globally averaged temperature rises, to calculate climate change at a local scale. At a glance, here are the average increases per trillion tonnes of carbon that we emit, separated geographically ( view the full table here ): Western North America 2.4   0.6 C Central North America 2.3   0.4 C Eastern North America 2.4   0.5 C Alaska 3.6   1.4 C Greenland and Northern Canada 3.1   0.9 C North Asia 3.1   0.9 C Southeast Asia 1.5   0.3 C Central America 1.8   0.4 C Eastern Africa 1.9   0.4 C  As these numbers show, equatorial regions warm the slowest, while the Arctic warms the fastest. Of course, this is what we ve already seen happen   rapid changes in the Arctic are outpacing the rest of the planet,  says Matthews. There are also marked differences between land and ocean, with the temperature increase for the oceans averaging 1.4   0.3 C TtC, compared to 2.2   0.5 C for land areas.  To date, humans have emitted almost 600 billion tonnes of carbon,  says Matthews.  This means that land areas on average have already warmed by 1.3 C because of these emissions. At current emission rates, we will have emitted enough CO 2 to warm land areas by 2 C within 3 decades.

Whether you re waiting for a bus that seems like it will never show up, or experiencing a sudden power outage on the subway, you are not alone: public transit woes are common around the world.   New research from Concordia uses mobile technology to map routes, calculate travel times and help alleviate some of the most pesky transport issues. Getting around in the developing world While transportation troubles might seem particularly painful in Western urban centres, they can be even more keenly felt in the developing world. That s why one of Zachary Patterson  s former students   now with the Agence fran aise de d veloppement  contacted him to map the public transit system in Ghana s capital, Accra. Patterson, an associate professor in the Department Geography, Planning and Environment , hopes the results of his project will help Western municipalities see how they can learn from these experiences in Africa.  Cities in the developing world face a common challenge when trying to better organize their transportation systems: they don t have accurate information about the transportation network that already exists,  says Patterson, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Transportation and Land Use Linkages for Regional Sustainability.  Because data collection is a complicated and costly exercise, city officials don t have the resources to thoroughly review their network,  he says.  That s why using inexpensive, readily available mobile technology is such a valuable tool.  The trouble with trotros At the heart of Accra s transit system is a fleet of small public transit buses known as trotros. The Accra Municipal Assembly has been working with AFD for a number of years to better regulate the trotro system. Initial regulatory steps identified and licensed routes, but the number of routes in operation and their actual itineraries, remained unknown. That s where Patterson, a former transportation planner with Agence m tropolitaine de transport in Montreal , came in. Accra s Department of Transport (DoT) and the Agence fran aise de d veloppement undertook a survey of the city s trotro routes armed with GPS-enabled smart phones to map the city s transit network with a very limited budget, and a short time frame. Using two mobile apps, DataMobile , which Patterson had initially developed at Concordia to map transportation habits in Montreal, and Tap Log , surveyors rode the trotros while recording GPS points and logging stops along the routes. The recorded data was then processed and analyzed by Patterson s research team back in Montreal. Ghost routes The results were surprising for both Patterson and Accra s city planners. They found that the transit network was full of  ghost routes    pathways that had been claimed by drivers but that weren t in use.  Drivers would preventatively register routes that they thought would one day be profitable in order to have a monopoly on them,  Patterson says.  Registering a route gives a driver the exclusive right to operate it, so that they can make sure that no competing driver can scoop them in the future.  These ghost routes were an important discovery for the DoT, as it provided a clearer sense of the actual extent of trotro services   315 active routes instead of the originally claimed 580. What s best for the West? The AccraMobile project was recently presented at the 95th annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board in the United States.  This study shows how international collaborations can play a role in helping developing countries to take advantage of leapfrogging technologies to plan their own transportation systems,  he says.   This research was partially funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada .

It was a celebration of collaborative design, and a chance to check out some cool new ideas for Montreal s parks. On April 28, Students and professors from Concordia and the Universit  de Montr al, and residents of the C te-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce (CDN NDG) borough gathered to mark the end of the first phase of an initiative to redesign two of its most popular green spaces. The project was conceived of as a way to build bridges between the borough s two districts, while drawing on the strengths of its universities. For part of it, 30 students from Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment were asked to re-imagine the site in front of the chalets of Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Park, on the corner of Girouard Avenue and Sherbrooke Street West, and Kent Park, on the corner of C te-des-Neiges Road and Kent Avenue.  From the beginning, we insisted that we shouldn't have a competition among the students, but instead work with them and the community in collaboration,  says Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor in the department, who was the university s lead academic on the project.  The outcome could be, for example, a monument, a plaza or an art installation,  says De la Llata.  The spaces will be completed and inaugurated in mid-2017 in the context of the city s 375th anniversary.  A user-driven design exercise The 30 Concordia students collaborated with 40 members of the public in a  design charrette,  consisting of two day-long sessions on-site at the parks  chalets.  A charrette is an intensive participatory design exercise in which professionals, scholars and/or students facilitate the visioning and conceptualization of an urban space or a project through a dialogue with the community,  De la Llata explains.  We had young people, elders, single and married people, dog owners, children, artists, and engineers. Each of them gave different inputs. Some mothers, for example, reported they would want to be able to watch their children in the playground but at the same time relax and have tea or coffee near the chalet.  Mainly, though, the design groups determined from the community members' input that they liked what was going on in the park already, De la Llata says. \"That is where the idea of the versatile/flexible platform came from   a space that is delivered to the community for them to transform, adapt and complete depending on the circumstances and needs.\" Jasmine Ali, an undergraduate student in  Urban Planning  and member of the Groupe NDG design team, says the involvement of the community was a key part of the process. \"It's their park, they go to it, they know more about it than us.\" In-situ design  A key idea behind the challenge was to plan the space from within the space itself, De la Llata says, explaining that the participants used ribbons, boxes and other items to delineate where elements of the design would be located.  This methodology, which we call  planning-in-situ,  is completely experimental   a method that democratizes urban design and planning. It involves conversations, presentations, walking tours, video-photographic analysis and sketching.\" At the end of the project, the Concordia students nominated two of their classmates, Ali and Faizan Jaffar   to receive internships worth $2,000 each. They ll work with the borough this summer to develop the park projects. \"I'm very grateful for this opportunity and looking forward to starting my internship,\" Ali says. \"As for my future plans, I'm looking towards continuing my education and doing a masters specifically in urban design.\" Jasmine Ali (pictured with borough mayor Russell Copeman) and Faizan Jaffar will receive internships worth $2,000 to develop the park projects. | Photos by Jean Beaudin for C te-des-Neiges Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Students from Universit  de Montr al s  landscape architecture department  also participated in a separate design charrette. Five teams from UdeM spent a weekend in Benny Library putting together their proposals. The first-place team was awarded a prize of $2,500, while the second-place team received $1,500.    A sense of unity and belonging   There was a lot of collegial and friendly collaboration among professors from UdeM and Concordia in the planning of the whole exercise,  De la Llata says.  We had meetings with city officials from the borough. They were very responsive to our proposals and adapted the exercise to suit the different needs of each school.  Borough mayor Russell Copeman, a Concordia alum and former associate vice-president of the university, was on hand to award prizes at the special event, held at La maison de la Culture C te-des-Neiges. The projects presented by the students from Concordia and UdeM are remarkable, said Copeman.  They fit directly into our vision for the 375th anniversary of Montreal, to support the sense of unity and belonging to all the citizens of our neighbourhoods, and to the common history of Montreal and our borough.\" For De la Llata, the experience illustrated the value of collaboration. \"It brings out the best in people,\" he says.  We're really proud of ourselves, as well as the community members of NDG and CDN, and everybody who participated in this project.   The spirit of this exercise is that these two public spaces, in which students and members of the community have collectively contributed their ideas, represent the union between two culturally and historically distinct neighbourhoods,  he adds.  It s a constructive dialogue between the past and the future of Montreal.  For more information, check out the  C te-des-Neiges Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce borough website  and Facebook page.

Here  Angela Kross  director of Concordia's new  GIS summer certification course  explains why it's the way of the future.   Concordia's Angela Kross | Photo by David Ward 'GIS helps us understand places' The story about the ingenious teen who developed a hypothesis about the location of major Mayan sites in relation to major stars is fascinating. According to  different news sources , William Gadoury used transparent overlays of star charts and known Mayan site maps. When one major star did not match any site, he used satellite images to explore the location further. The process he used to develop and test his hypothesis involves some very typical and conventional geographic information system (GIS) tasks: the use of map overlays and satellite remote sensing. Satellite images allow us to observe and measure objects anywhere on earth, but interpretations need to be careful and validated. The satellite images in this case, for example, revealed a set of geometric structures (e.g. rectangles) under the vegetation canopy. It is hard to attribute these structures to natural phenomena. Man-made structures such as the Maya temples could cause such features in the images. But so could old abandoned agriculture fields, for example (or something else). Only a field expedition could give a true validation of this hypothesis, which could become a very difficult and expensive process. This is where GIS and remote sensing can play a very important role. For example, if the features were indeed caused by an old agriculture/corn field, satellite images of 5, 10 or 20 years ago could help explain the nature of the observed features. Spatial data and maps of communities that live around that area (if they exist) or maps of agriculture activities in that area would also help us understand whether the features could be caused by recent activities. All this information (satellite images and maps) can be displayed and analyzed using free open source or proprietary GIS software.   5 great uses of GIS The application of GIS has no limitations, as long as we have spatial information (location, location, location!). GIS can play a powerful role in assisting scientists, business specialists and community organizations validate hypotheses and communicate information and research from many domains. Biology and environmental health specialists, for example, may want to map the distribution of the Zika vector (mosquitoes) habitat worldwide. Will increasing temperatures push the boundaries of those habitats? An urban planner may want to map green spaces in the city to evaluate the need for increased green areas. A high school teacher may want to teach history classes using GIS storytelling: attaching dates to places and photos; all on Google Earth for example. An NGO may want to collect information from aboriginal communities to map the most important lands, according to them (participatory GIS). A transport company may want to know if their existing routes are actually covering the needs of the consumers. Where would new services be needed? GIS helps us to understand places, to detect and understand spatial patterns and to determine relationships between variables over time and space. GIS plays an important role in bridging multiple disciplines, and in enabling collaboration using one platform.

Concordia expert Rosemary Collard weighs in on the debate Posted on May 20, 2016 | By: Rosemary Collard Photo by AV Design (Flickr Creative Commons) Rosemary Collard is an assistant professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment at Concordia.   Would you take an arsenic pill to cure a skin problem? Squeeze into a corset so tight it could kill you over time? These popular trends of the Victorian age have thankfully fallen out of favor. Now it s time to let go of one more vestige of that bygone era: horse-drawn carriages. The City of Montreal took a step in that direction this week when Mayor Denis Coderre announced a year-long moratorium on cal ches   the horse-drawn carriages that carry people   mostly tourists   around Old Montreal. The city s 24 carriage operators will be reimbursed for the cost of their operation permits, which have been suspended. The 56 cal che horses who live and work in Montreal have been the subject of fierce debate between tourism officials, members of the public, animal advocates and the horses' owners. This debate bubbles up almost annually, every time a horse collapses in the street, or collides with a car, as was the case last month in Griffintown . Advocates of the cal che industry say that the horses are part of the city s identity, a source of employment and a draw for tourists. They point to city veterinarians who have reportedly found that the horses  health has improved since the city has taken measures to regulate the industry over the last few years. These measures include bylaws to  protect  the horses, like requirements that they not work in above-30 degree weather, and that they rest at least six hours a day. But even if these bylaws are enforced, horses can still be worked 18 hours a day in 29-degree heat. Under the law, the cal che horses are property, equivalent to the cars with which they share the busy streets. Of course, unlike cars, horses are living, social creatures. The cal che horses are better thought of as workers, but workers who receive no compensation beyond the basic provisions for their survival. They are workers who are exposed to dangerous working conditions, navigating the traffic, construction zones and exhaust of modern city streets. They are workers who, now unemployed for the year, will hopefully be sent to a refuge rather than a slaughterhouse, as cal che operators are threatening. The province of Quebec recently passed a bill that defines animals as sentient beings. This bill responds to a cultural shift underway, in which the designations of animals as property are archaic, like the cal che industry. Following this bill and the lead of other major cities like Paris and Beijing, Montreal should extend the cal che moratorium into a permanent ban, relinquishing a punishing practice that long ago went out of date.

Farkas remembers the moment like it was yesterday:  He was looking at this taped-up poster of his concert we did at the Corona Theatre when I approached him and said,  Hi Mr. Bradley. Do you like the poster?  As vice president of Concerts and Events for Montreal concert promotion and production company evenko, Nick Farkas, BA 90, runs Montreal s Osheaga annual music festival. | Photo credit: Susan Moss  I really like it,  Bradley replied.  That was a great show.  After Farkas welcomed Bradley back to Montreal, the singer told him,  I ve been here before.   Yes, you were at Osheaga a few years ago,  Farkas said.  No, I ve been here before.  Bradley then pointed to where the Place des Nations stage used to be.  I played here in 1967.   I was speechless,  Farkas says today.  To experience that with him right there was beyond cool   it was a surreal moment, my all-time favourite Osheaga story.  Veteran Australian band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds played in 2014 at Osheaga, one of the few festivals they appeared at. | Photo credit: Susan Moss As co-founder of Osheaga , IleSoniq , Heavy Montr al and the YUL EAT festivals, Farkas has pretty much seen it all. He got his start booking shows while still a student at Concordia.  I started with a buddy of mine in the late 1980s. We were very into punk rock and the bands we wanted to see weren t coming to Montreal very often,  Farkas recalls.  So we started calling up bands and booking them. We did it just to see the bands we wanted to see. The bands would come to Montreal, they d sleep on our floor and we d do all the work,  Farkas says.  I never thought this would become an actual job, but I co-founded Greenland Productions in 1993 and did that for a few years. I had a chance to make a real living at it, and it s been nonstop ever since.  The Hamilton-born, Montreal-raised Farkas is now vice president of Concerts and Events for Montreal concert promotion and production company evenko , which presented  1,300 shows last year from Vermont to Newfoundland,  Farkas reports. The notorious Iggy Pop wowed the crowd at Osheaga in 2008. Photo credit: Susan Moss  It s a huge amount of work. With Osheaga, we have reached the point 11 years in where we have a much bigger office, a much bigger team. But it s very uniting in terms of business: we are 100 per cent in control of the creative, the production and who we book,  he says.  There are various people in the booking department of various ages   me being the oldest   and everybody fights for the bands they would like to see at the festival. It s a very long process. There are 110 acts on the bill and we want every act to be the best act possible.  Farkas recalls:  We used to sit in a room with a board with band names cut out on pieces of paper and we moved them around in the schedule to find the best order possible. Now we re a bit more savvy and do it with computers. But we still strategize the same way   we look at every slot and we really try to gap it so you can catch 10 minutes of this, and 15 minutes of that. I love the idea of people discovering new music and running from one stage to another.  Lana Del Rey is one of the headliners at the 11th edition of Osheaga, July 29 to 31, 2016. The 11th edition of Osheaga , July 29 to 31, features headliners Lana Del Rey, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Radiohead.  We booked Radiohead in Montreal for the first time at the 500-capacity club Woodstock back in 1993,  says Farkas.  We were literally doing Nirvana that same night at the Verdun Auditorium and raced uptown to catch the end of Radiohead! That was how you did it back then   you played a club, then came back to play the next size up.

I was booking shows on the side and working as a bike messenger,  says Farkas.  Did I devote myself to my studies? Nope, but it was important to me and my future to get a degree,  he says.  I hate starting things and not finishing them. I got a lot out of it, learnt critical thought, and solidified my way of looking at stuff.  Farkas adds:  Today I am living a dream. I remember my father telling me as a teenager,  If you can find a job that you wake up every morning and want to go to, then you re ahead of 95 per cent of the people in the world.  And I wake up in the morning and want to go to work every day.  The Osheaga Music and Arts Festival runs July 29 to 31 at Parc Jean-Drapeau.

Two Concordia researchers have revealed alarming growth patterns. Here are their solutions Posted on July 6, 2016 | By: Cl a Desjardins An example of urban sprawl around the autoroute 15 and 40 interchange. | Photos by Craig Townsend With more than half of the world s population now living in cities, urban sprawl is a growing problem   particularly in North America, where single-family homes and two-car garages are common. But it s also an increasing concern in various European countries, where living large is becoming more and more attractive. Just how fast are cities increasing in size? And are there ways for us to slow their expansion? New research from Concordia shows that there s indeed a lot more we could be doing to combat urban sprawl   and European countries are leading the way. Measuring and mapping  Before we can put a stop to urban sprawl, it s important to understand how to reliably measure it,  says Concordia geography professor Jochen Jaeger , co-author* of a recent joint European Environment Agency / Federal Office for the Environment report.  To do that, we developed a metric called Weighted Urban Proliferation   or WUP. It takes into account how much of an area is built up, the spatial dispersion of the built-up areas, and how many people live or work in a given place.  Once Jaeger and his co-authors had developed the WUP method, the research team combed through detailed data sets on 32 European countries to map out general trends and pinpoint problem areas. They found that large parts of Europe are affected by urban sprawl, with the lowest levels in Iceland and the highest in the Netherlands and Belgium. At a more granular level, sprawl is most pronounced in wide rings around city centres, along large transport corridors and along coastlines. The lowest levels of sprawl are mainly associated with mountain ranges or remote areas   hence Iceland s ranking.  This is the first report to provide a comparable measurement of urban sprawl for all EU and European Free Trade Association countries. It clearly shows that the rate of sprawl is increasing, and confirms there is an urgent need for action,  says Jaeger. On this side of the pond In North America, the situation is worse. In Montreal and Quebec City, urban sprawl is increasing at an exponential rate, according to a study co-authored by recent Concordia graduate, Naghmeh Nazarnia. Using the WUP method, she compared the two cities and found that urban sprawl has accelerated continuously since 1951, with the fastest increases taking place in the last 25 years. In Montreal, the degree of urban sprawl went up 26-fold from 1971 to 2011, while in Quebec City, it rose ninefold.  Compare these levels to a European city like Zurich, and you ll see the opposite trend. Here in Quebec, the fastest increases in sprawl have been observed in the last 25 years, whereas there the strongest acceleration was in the 1960s. This comparative analysis can help land-use planners control urban sprawl. The WUP method can also be used to establish targets and limits, and to see how effective those control measures are,  says Nazarnia.   Urban sprawl in Laval. Less sprawl, but not more high-rises The researchers caution that if we want to stop the exponential increase, we have to take action now. But the solution is not to build more high-rises. Simply put, the best solution is to use and re-use land sparingly. For Jaeger and Nazarnia, a combination of measures work best: Brownfield recycling   repurposing land previously used for industrial purposes, which has huge potential in cities with industrial pasts like Montreal. Careful population densification. Transit-oriented development through better coordination between transport ministries and cities. Stronger planning legislation. Nazarnia notes that these measures are already being undertaken in Europe.  Zurich, for example, has stronger planning legislation, much higher levels of public transportation and much lower levels of road traffic than Montreal and Quebec,  she says. In fact, some innovations are already taking place on both sides of the Atlantic to stop urban sprawl, Jaeger points out.  One great example is the Alternative Bank of Switzerland,  which will not give mortgages  to development projects that contribute strongly to an increase in urban sprawl. Another is the Canadian government s  recent move  to halt a construction project in a Montreal suburb in order to  protect chorus frogs ,  he says.  These are steps in the right direction, and hopefully a sign of things to come. We have set official limits on air pollution and water pollution. Why not set similar limits on urban sprawl?  *Partners in research: The study about urban sprawl in Europe was funded in part by the Swiss Confederation, with additional support from the European Environment Agency.

How can we find solutions to the world s pressing societal and environmental problems? One way is to provide free education on international issues on a global scale. So, beginning this fall, Concordia is teaming up with the United Nations to offer its first-ever Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), designed to help global citizens answer this sort of question.   Wicked Problems, Dynamic Solutions: The Ecosystem Approach and Systems Thinking   is an interdisciplinary course open to all. Anyone who is interested will have the opportunity to learn about complex ideas such as ecological resilience, environmental governance, urban biodiversity and the impact of climate change in an accessible way.  While there are many MOOCs out there that introduce ecosystem services and related topics, this is one of the first that focuses explicitly on the ecosystem approach, long adopted as desirable by the UN, while covering so many key ecosystems and overarching themes  explains Peter Stoett , director of the Loyola Sustainability Research Centre (LSRC). A Canadian first The Education Department of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi contacted Stoett last year about the possibility of setting up a MOOC together. He immediately set about securing the support of colleagues from across the university.  This is the first time Concordia has worked with the UN on a major online educational project,  Stoett says, adding that Concordia s partnership with UNEP on a large-scale MOOC is also a first for a Canadian university. The Department of Geography, Planning and Environment (GPE) will host the course, which will feature speakers from both GPE and LSRC, including Stoett and fellow researchers in the areas of environment and sustainability,   Damon Matthews , Annie Lalancette , Katja Neves, and Pascale Biron   all of whom helped to develop various aspects of the course. Concordia experts will be joined by international colleagues from UNEP in Nairobi and elsewhere.  We are very excited about this initiative and proud to be associated with a MOOC that has been so thoughtfully and collaboratively designed and developed,\" says Monica Mulrennan , Associate Professor and Chair of GPE. Always eager to provide Concordia students with exciting options,  Stoett and FAS Dean Andr  Roy ensured that the initiative will include a course credit option  ( GEOG 298   Selected Topics in Geography ), in a blended-learning format   partly online and partly in the classroom.  This will provide a greatly enriched opportunity for students to engage with the material they ve been exposed to through the MOOC and take it further,  says Mulrennan. Facilitating international dialogue The MOOC is being produced in partnership with KnowledgeOne, the digital learning developer for all of Concordia s online courses. CEO Robert Beauchemin says there was a steep learning curve involved, referring to the technical complexity of the powerful Open edX platform adopted for the course.  We are eager to step up to the challenge of seeing this project succeed.  For those wishing to take the online-only course, registration is free and open to all. A high-school level education is recommended.  The MOOC will provide the opportunity for students and professionals from across the world to interact,  says LSRC Co-ordinator Rebecca Tittler .  Participants will also be able to apply course material from their own geographic perspectives.  For example, the course includes interactive mapping exercises which ask students to post pictures from their neighbourhood and then link them to similar pictures from elsewhere. The course will also have an active online discussion board to facilitate international dialogue about the issues being taught.  Wicked Problems, Dynamic Solutions  was designed to be open to as many people as possible.  It is all about accessibility,  says Stoett.  Thousands of individuals from various age groups and backgrounds can take the course.  Available on your mobile One other crucial element   people can follow the course on their cell phones.  This is important because in many places around the world, cell phones may be a lot more accessible than computers,  explains Tittler. Both Mulrennan and Stoett agree it will be important to pay close attention to how this initial MOOC works in practice, in case the university wants to plan for more of them in the future.  The course is considered a pilot project this fall,  says Stoett.  After that, we will revisit the entire production and teaching process and strive to improve it.  For now, with registration up and running, enthusiasm for the course is high. The university is already committed to developing another UNEP-based MOOC for 2017, and discussions are ongoing around a third option.  We are certainly teaching for tomorrow with MOOCs and blended-learning approaches,  Stoett says.  But more importantly, we are teaching the basics of an ecosystem approach that will be vital to the survival of future generations.  Learn more about the course or register.  Concordia students wishing to take the blended course can register online via the MyConcordia portal.  The course begins on Monday, September 12.

How will we cope with rising sea levels and climbing temperatures? But it's not just humans who will be affected by these worldwide shifts   it's our closest cousins, too: monkeys, apes and lemurs. A new Concordia study published in the International Journal of Primatology shows that the world's primate populations may be seriously impacted by climate change. \"Our research shows that climate change may be one of the biggest emerging threats to primates, compounding existing pressures from deforestation, hunting and the exotic pet trade,\" says Tanya Graham, the article's lead author and an MSc student in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment . She worked with environment professor Damon Matthews from Concordia and primatology post-doctoral researcher Sarah Turner from McGill to assess the exposure and potential vulnerability of all non-human primate species to projected future temperature and precipitation changes. They found that overall, 419 species of non-human primates   such as various species of lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, monkeys and apes  will experience 10 per cent more warming than the global average, with some primate species experiencing increases of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in annual average temperature for every degree of global warming. The researchers also identified several hotspots of primate vulnerability to climate change, based on the combination of the number of species, their endangered status and the severity of climate changes at each location. Overall, the most extreme hotspots, which represent the upper 10 per cent of all hotspot scores, cover a total area of 3,622,012 square kilometres over the ranges of 67 primate species. The highest hotspot scores occur in Central America, the Amazon and southeastern Brazil, as well as portions of East and Southeast Asia   prime territory for some of the globe's best-known primates who call these areas home. The ursine howler monkey, black howler monkey, and barbary macaque are expected to be exposed to the highest magnitude of climate change when both temperature and precipitation are considered. For example, the ursine howler monkey, found in Venezuela, will experience an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius annually and a 5.3 per cent decline in annual rainfall for each degree of global temperature increase. \"This study highlights the vulnerability of individual species, as well as regions in which primates as a whole may be vulnerable to climate change,\" says Matthews, who will present the findings of this study during the Joint Meeting of the International Primatological Society and the American Society of Primatologists in Chicago later this month. \"Our findings can be taken as priorities for ongoing conservation efforts, given that any success in decreasing other current human pressures on endangered species may also increase that species  ability to withstand the growing pressures of climate changes,  says Graham.  Primates are often seen as flagship species for entire ecosystems, so conservation can have important ramifications for many other species too. I hope our study will help direct conservation efforts for individual primate species in particular, but also for vulnerable ecosystems in general throughout the tropical regions inhabited by non-human primates,\" adds Turner.

Concordia professor  Zachary Patterson  is teaming up with the City of Montreal to launch MTLTrajet , a mobile app that will help the city learn more about how its citizens navigate from point A to point B.  I wanted to be able to undertake transportation and land-use research using emerging data sources,  says Patterson, an associate professor of geography, planning and environment in the  Faculty of Arts and Science.  However, getting ahold of this kind of data proved difficult. So, using smartphones, I developed an app to collect my own data.  DataMobile The app initially launched as  DataMobile , a 2014 pilot project. Close to 900 people downloaded the app, which prompted them to take part in a survey before it recorded their trips throughout the day using their smartphone. Developed at Concordia s  TRIP Lab , the app asked users for information such as their purpose of travel and chosen mode of transport.  Its purpose was to test how well we can use smartphones to collect travel data for transportation planning purposes,  says Patterson. The app proved popular, and was used in studies as far away as Ghana. Closer to home, it will be used in five Canadian cities   Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax   as part of this fall's  Canada Food Study . MTLTrajet The City of Montreal became interested when Patterson was a mentor at  MTL Cycle Challenge  (MCC), an initiative designed to improve cycling in the city by using data sets to create urban mobility solutions. At MCC, Patterson discussed the DataMobile project with representatives from the city's transport department and the  Montr al, Smart City  initiative.  The city is very enthusiastic about the adoption of new technologies in transport-related data collection,  says Patterson. After he was invited to give a presentation on DataMobile for city officials, they asked him to use it as the basis of MTLTrajet. In advance of its October 17 launch, the app is already generating plenty of buzz, on the streets and at City Hall.  It has been great working with the city,  says Patterson.  Converting data to information How will the results help advance Patterson s research? MTLTrajet will help Patterson and other researchers  figure out how to convert mere data to information.   It s a potentially effective tool because almost everyone carries around smartphones that know where they are, which can collect crucial transportation data,  says Patterson. He emphasizes the app s data collection is transparent.  The process is completely overt, so that respondents will know what data is being collected from them.  In the long term, Patterson s goal is to gather enough data to develop algorithms that will make it unnecessary to have any user input at all. Additional studies are already being planned by the University of Toronto, the  Institut national de recherche scientifique  s Montreal office, the  Agence m tropolitaine de transport ,  BIXI , the  STM  and the  Quebec  Ministry of Transport .  A travel survey collection effort is also being developed in Lahore, Pakistan. So, if you ve spent your summer playing Pok mon GO and are craving a new smartphone pastime while out and about, MTLTrajet may just be your new fall fix.  They both operate on smartphones and keep track of the location of the phone,  admits Patterson.  But it is different, in that it's not a game   and uses less battery, I hope!

How does the public space surrounding the downtown campus define us as a university community? This is a question addressed in the eighth instalment of the Quartier Concordia series , currently exhibited in the vitrines of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV). Public Spaces and Gathering Places highlights the creation of Norman Bethune Square as a gathering point for numerous rallies, the use of Mackay Street as a concert ground and the recent development of Zone  ducation Culture on Bishop Street. Clarence Epstein, senior director of Urban and Cultural Affairs at Concordia, points out that people have come together around the university   in Stanley Cup parades, demonstrations, performances and cultural events   mostly in spaces not designed as gathering places.  Following the construction of Cabot Square in the late 19th century, very little priority was given to public space planning,  he says.  What we recognize as gathering places have appeared as a result of the way the neighbourhood has evolved. They ve been appropriated by the various people and organizations who live in and occupy these spaces.   Proactive changes  Now, the planning of new public areas is a priority for the city s administration and local stakeholders, including the university. In tandem with the new exhibition, Concordia joined with the City of Montreal s Department of Public Works to launch a visioning charrette to engage the entire community in determining the future of the alley that runs south of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) between Mackay and Bishop streets. A charrette is a participatory design program allowing professionals, scholars and students to join community stakeholders in discussing and visualizing the possibilities for an urban space.  We understand from the City of Montreal that this space is going to change,  Epstein says, noting that municipal officials have also placed a reserve on an adjacent parcel of land slated for a park at the corner of Mackay and Ste-Catherine streets.  The goal of the charrette and other initiatives like it is to inform good design decisions through collective reflection and communication.  The LB Alley charrette took place on October 21 and 22 in the LB atrium, J.A. DeS ve Cinema and in the alley itself. The public was invited to engage in  planning-in-situ,  with walks-through, video-photographic analysis and community sketches. Discussions were led by Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor of geography, planning and environment in the Faculty of Arts and Science . He says the process encourages the public to plan spaces for themselves   from the spaces, because they are the ultimate users. From Modernism to democratization De la Llata explains that in the first half of the 20th century, the dominant approach to urban planning was Modernism, in which form followed the function architects believed spaces should have, rather than the way they were actually used. Modernist planners felt they knew best how people should behave, and built cities designed to coerce citizens into using spaces as they intended them to. According to De la Llata, this resulted in a wide array of urban planning disasters.  Modernist planning transformed cities in a way that wasn t very democratic,  he says.  The motivation here is democratization. We want to understand what qualities people want to see in the space, and to give a chance to Montrealers, the Concordia community, St. Jax Church, McKibbins Irish Pub and other restaurants and businesses on the periphery of the alley to participate in the planning and design of the space.

Damon Matthews is a geography, planning and environment professor and Concordia University Research Chair (Climate Science and Sustainability) in the Faculty of Arts and Science . Following the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on November 4, Matthews co-authored* an op-ed about what it will take for Canada to uphold its commitment to combatting climate change. The Paris Agreement was ratified earlier this month and is unprecedented amongst international agreements for how quickly it has come into force. This agreement allows each country to decide how it will tackle climate change and requires, as of 2020, regular reporting on progress. Countries of the world have officially embarked on a global race to implement ambitious climate policies that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the planetary scale. This process is not unlike the Olympic Games where countries get together to compare their strengths and performance. If Canada wants to be a medalist in 2020, domestic climate policies must rapidly be adopted to accelerate the low carbon transition. In this context, Sustainable Canada Dialogues   a network of 60+ scholars from across Canada   produced a progress report on the country s climate actions over the past year. We analyzed climate decisions made in Ottawa in 2016 in relationship to the 10 policy orientations that we proposed previously in our position paper entitled Acting on Climate Change: Solutions from Canadian Scholars . Canada took two important steps forward. First, the federal government will price carbon throughout the country starting in 2018. Second, the $120 billion infrastructure investment plan explicitly highlights support for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This investment plan raises hopes that Canada can make the transition to low carbon development, but its real impact depends on identifying and funding infrastructure projects that best contribute to desired low-carbon and sustainable outcomes. Despite this progress, the decision to approve the Pacific NorthWest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is a step backward, casting doubt on the willingness of the federal government to meaningfully tackle climate change. The impact assessment indicates that this LNG project would be one of the largest point source of emissions in Canada and would increase British Columbia s emissions by 8.5 per cent. Continued development of projects with high greenhouse gas emissions will compromise progress in other sectors. It will prevent Canada from meeting its emissions reduction target for 2030, and is incompatible with Canada s stated goal to help limit global temperature increases to 1.5oC. Research indeed estimates that, to maintain global temperature increase below 2oC, half of existing gas reserves and one third of existing oil ones must remain unused. Canadian climate policy must tackle the most difficult question: how to transition away from fossil fuels? We call for federal political leadership that steadily and strategically adopts innovative low-carbon tools to drive future economic growth. This requires engaging with a broad range of stakeholders from the oil and gas industry, unions, Indigenous peoples, environmental NGOs, the clean technology sector and academia to discuss how to reorient subsidies away from the fossil fuel industry, promote transitions to low-carbon energy, while ensuring that workers from the oil and gas industry can transition their skills to other sectors. Ambitious Canadian climate leadership is necessary more than ever in North America. Only by working together and building commitment across all sectors will Canada live up to the expectations it rose by joining the High Ambition Coalition in 2015. Despite positive steps, the federal government has been unable so far to develop a coherent climate action plan largely because of its inability to address fossil fuels coherently.

That s what faculty members and community representatives will team up to discuss at the next Beyond Disciplines event, taking place Thursday, December 1, on Concordia s Loyola Campus. Organized by Andr  Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS), in collaboration with the Office of Community Engagement, the series examines the role of mutual learning in research. Building bridges/Going beyond the walls will pair FAS faculty members and the community representatives they work with. Chedly Belkhodja , professor and principal of the School of Community and Public Affairs, is hosting the event.  Engaging with community is at the heart of what we do at the school,  he says.  It s wonderful to see the dean has chosen this topic.  Ann-Louise Davidson , an associate professor in Education, concurs.  The research we do is not contained inside the physical walls of the university.  The post-event reception will be hosted by Loyola s Hive Caf  Co-op , which serves a free sustainable lunch for the Loyola community every weekday. Attendees will also get to check out an art project facilitated by La Ruche d'Art NDG Art Hive .  We are thrilled to be participating. It s going to be a lot of fun,  says the Hive Caf  Co-op s events coordinator Paige Hilderman. The speakers include Davidson and her colleague, assistant professor  Giuliana Cucinelli , as well as Chris Colley and Christine Truesdale of LEARN Quebec , a group that helps minorities in the province s school system. Together they will discuss maker culture in an educational context.  Going beyond the walls means engaging in discussions to see how we can build synergies through concrete activities where true collaboration can exist,  Davidson says.  We are conducting research in a living lab. We might not all be playing the same roles, but we can speak to each other.  Eva Pomeroy , a lecturer in Applied Human Sciences, will be joined by C dric Jamet, a partner from percolab . Jamet co-designed and co-facilitated the Concordia ULab Social Innovation Hub , an experiment in transformative education that was launched this fall.  There is such incredible potential in partnering with the community,  says Pomeroy.  We can continuously co-create learning that is aligned with the needs of the world outside the university in the present moment.    Also at the December 1 event,  Anna-Liisa Aunio , an adjunct professor with the Loyola College for Diversity and Sustainability, will discuss her research on food justice sustainability with Ga lle Janvier of Alternatives Montreal. Monica Mulrennan , chair of the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment, will outline her work with Northern Cree populations alongside deputy grand chief Rodney Mark .  Meanwhile, Varda Mann-Feder , also in Applied Human Sciences, will profile her partnership with C.A.R.E. Jeunesse , an organization that helps youth who are transitioning out of government care. For Mann-Feder, community collaboration has been a transformative experience.  These young people have thrived against all odds and are the embodiment of resilience. It is very humbling for me as a researcher to work alongside them.  Beyond Disciplines: Building bridges/Going beyond the walls takes place at 5 p.m. on Thursday, December 1, in Room 110.00 of the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics (GE) on Concordia s Loyola Campus (7141 Sherbrooke St. W.).

Concordia expert Rosemary Collard weighs in on the debate Posted on May 20, 2016 | By: Rosemary Collard Photo by AV Design (Flickr Creative Commons) Rosemary Collard is an assistant professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment at Concordia.   Would you take an arsenic pill to cure a skin problem? Squeeze into a corset so tight it could kill you over time? These popular trends of the Victorian age have thankfully fallen out of favor. Now it s time to let go of one more vestige of that bygone era: horse-drawn carriages. The City of Montreal took a step in that direction this week when Mayor Denis Coderre announced a year-long moratorium on cal ches   the horse-drawn carriages that carry people   mostly tourists   around Old Montreal. The city s 24 carriage operators will be reimbursed for the cost of their operation permits, which have been suspended. The 56 cal che horses who live and work in Montreal have been the subject of fierce debate between tourism officials, members of the public, animal advocates and the horses' owners. This debate bubbles up almost annually, every time a horse collapses in the street, or collides with a car, as was the case last month in Griffintown . Advocates of the cal che industry say that the horses are part of the city s identity, a source of employment and a draw for tourists. They point to city veterinarians who have reportedly found that the horses  health has improved since the city has taken measures to regulate the industry over the last few years. These measures include bylaws to  protect  the horses, like requirements that they not work in above-30 degree weather, and that they rest at least six hours a day. But even if these bylaws are enforced, horses can still be worked 18 hours a day in 29-degree heat. Under the law, the cal che horses are property, equivalent to the cars with which they share the busy streets. Of course, unlike cars, horses are living, social creatures. The cal che horses are better thought of as workers, but workers who receive no compensation beyond the basic provisions for their survival. They are workers who are exposed to dangerous working conditions, navigating the traffic, construction zones and exhaust of modern city streets. They are workers who, now unemployed for the year, will hopefully be sent to a refuge rather than a slaughterhouse, as cal che operators are threatening . The province of Quebec recently passed a bill that defines animals as sentient beings. This bill responds to a cultural shift underway, in which the designations of animals as property are archaic, like the cal che industry. Following this bill and the lead of other major cities like Paris and Beijing, Montreal should extend the cal che moratorium into a permanent ban, relinquishing a punishing practice that long ago went out of date.

Farkas remembers the moment like it was yesterday:  He was looking at this taped-up poster of his concert we did at the Corona Theatre when I approached him and said,  Hi Mr. Bradley. Do you like the poster?  As vice president of Concerts and Events for Montreal concert promotion and production company evenko, Nick Farkas, BA 90, runs Montreal s Osheaga annual music festival. | Photo credit: Susan Moss  I really like it,  Bradley replied.  That was a great show.  After Farkas welcomed Bradley back to Montreal, the singer told him,  I ve been here before.   Yes, you were at Osheaga a few years ago,  Farkas said.  No, I ve been here before.  Bradley then pointed to where the Place des Nations stage used to be.  I played here in 1967.   I was speechless,  Farkas says today.  To experience that with him right there was beyond cool   it was a surreal moment, my all-time favourite Osheaga story.  Veteran Australian band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds played in 2014 at Osheaga, one of the few festivals they appeared at. | Photo credit: Susan Moss As co-founder of Osheaga , IleSoniq , Heavy Montr al and the YUL EAT festivals, Farkas has pretty much seen it all. He got his start booking shows while still a student at Concordia.  I started with a buddy of mine in the late 1980s. We were very into punk rock and the bands we wanted to see weren t coming to Montreal very often,  Farkas recalls.  So we started calling up bands and booking them. We did it just to see the bands we wanted to see. The bands would come to Montreal, they d sleep on our floor and we d do all the work,  Farkas says.  I never thought this would become an actual job, but I co-founded Greenland Productions in 1993 and did that for a few years. I had a chance to make a real living at it, and it s been nonstop ever since.  The Hamilton-born, Montreal-raised Farkas is now vice president of Concerts and Events for Montreal concert promotion and production company evenko , which presented  1,300 shows last year from Vermont to Newfoundland,  Farkas reports. The notorious Iggy Pop wowed the crowd at Osheaga in 2008. Photo credit: Susan Moss  It s a huge amount of work. With Osheaga, we have reached the point 11 years in where we have a much bigger office, a much bigger team. But it s very uniting in terms of business: we are 100 per cent in control of the creative, the production and who we book,  he says.  There are various people in the booking department of various ages   me being the oldest   and everybody fights for the bands they would like to see at the festival. It s a very long process. There are 110 acts on the bill and we want every act to be the best act possible.  Farkas recalls:  We used to sit in a room with a board with band names cut out on pieces of paper and we moved them around in the schedule to find the best order possible. Now we re a bit more savvy and do it with computers. But we still strategize the same way   we look at every slot and we really try to gap it so you can catch 10 minutes of this, and 15 minutes of that. I love the idea of people discovering new music and running from one stage to another.  Lana Del Rey is one of the headliners at the 11th edition of Osheaga, July 29 to 31, 2016. The 11th edition of Osheaga , July 29 to 31, features headliners Lana Del Rey, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Radiohead.  We booked Radiohead in Montreal for the first time at the 500-capacity club Woodstock back in 1993,  says Farkas.  We were literally doing Nirvana that same night at the Verdun Auditorium and raced uptown to catch the end of Radiohead! That was how you did it back then   you played a club, then came back to play the next size up.  Farkas, a married father of a five-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter   both of whom are also Osheaga veterans   credits his years at Concordia for helping him grow his career.

I was booking shows on the side and working as a bike messenger,  says Farkas.  Did I devote myself to my studies? Nope, but it was important to me and my future to get a degree,  he says.  I hate starting things and not finishing them. I got a lot out of it, learnt critical thought, and solidified my way of looking at stuff.  Farkas adds:  Today I am living a dream. I remember my father telling me as a teenager,  If you can find a job that you wake up every morning and want to go to, then you re ahead of 95 per cent of the people in the world.  And I wake up in the morning and want to go to work every day.  The Osheaga Music and Arts Festival runs July 29 to 31 at Parc Jean-Drapeau.

Two Concordia researchers have revealed alarming growth patterns. Here are their solutions Posted on July 6, 2016 | By: Cl a Desjardins An example of urban sprawl around the autoroute 15 and 40 interchange. | Photos by Craig Townsend With more than half of the world s population now living in cities, urban sprawl is a growing problem   particularly in North America, where single-family homes and two-car garages are common. But it s also an increasing concern in various European countries, where living large is becoming more and more attractive. Just how fast are cities increasing in size? And are there ways for us to slow their expansion? New research from Concordia shows that there s indeed a lot more we could be doing to combat urban sprawl   and European countries are leading the way. Measuring and mapping  Before we can put a stop to urban sprawl, it s important to understand how to reliably measure it,  says Concordia geography professor Jochen Jaeger , co-author* of a recent joint European Environment Agency / Federal Office for the Environment report.  To do that, we developed a metric called Weighted Urban Proliferation   or WUP. It takes into account how much of an area is built up, the spatial dispersion of the built-up areas, and how many people live or work in a given place.  Once Jaeger and his co-authors had developed the WUP method, the research team combed through detailed data sets on 32 European countries to map out general trends and pinpoint problem areas. They found that large parts of Europe are affected by urban sprawl, with the lowest levels in Iceland and the highest in the Netherlands and Belgium. At a more granular level, sprawl is most pronounced in wide rings around city centres, along large transport corridors and along coastlines. The lowest levels of sprawl are mainly associated with mountain ranges or remote areas   hence Iceland s ranking.  This is the first report to provide a comparable measurement of urban sprawl for all EU and European Free Trade Association countries. It clearly shows that the rate of sprawl is increasing, and confirms there is an urgent need for action,  says Jaeger. On this side of the pond In North America, the situation is worse. In Montreal and Quebec City, urban sprawl is increasing at an exponential rate, according to a study co-authored by recent Concordia graduate, Naghmeh Nazarnia. Using the WUP method, she compared the two cities and found that urban sprawl has accelerated continuously since 1951, with the fastest increases taking place in the last 25 years. In Montreal, the degree of urban sprawl went up 26-fold from 1971 to 2011, while in Quebec City, it rose ninefold.  Compare these levels to a European city like Zurich, and you ll see the opposite trend. Here in Quebec, the fastest increases in sprawl have been observed in the last 25 years, whereas there the strongest acceleration was in the 1960s. This comparative analysis can help land-use planners control urban sprawl. The WUP method can also be used to establish targets and limits, and to see how effective those control measures are,  says Nazarnia.   Urban sprawl in Laval. Less sprawl, but not more high-rises The researchers caution that if we want to stop the exponential increase, we have to take action now. But the solution is not to build more high-rises. Simply put, the best solution is to use and re-use land sparingly. For Jaeger and Nazarnia, a combination of measures work best: Brownfield recycling   repurposing land previously used for industrial purposes, which has huge potential in cities with industrial pasts like Montreal. Careful population densification. Transit-oriented development through better coordination between transport ministries and cities. Stronger planning legislation. Nazarnia notes that these measures are already being undertaken in Europe.  Zurich, for example, has stronger planning legislation, much higher levels of public transportation and much lower levels of road traffic than Montreal and Quebec,  she says. In fact, some innovations are already taking place on both sides of the Atlantic to stop urban sprawl, Jaeger points out.  One great example is the Alternative Bank of Switzerland,  which will not give mortgages  to development projects that contribute strongly to an increase in urban sprawl. Another is the Canadian government s  recent move  to halt a construction project in a Montreal suburb in order to  protect chorus frogs ,  he says.  These are steps in the right direction, and hopefully a sign of things to come. We have set official limits on air pollution and water pollution. Why not set similar limits on urban sprawl?  *Partners in research: The study about urban sprawl in Europe was funded in part by the Swiss Confederation, with additional support from the European Environment Agency. Additional co-authors on the European Environment Agency / Federal Office for the Environment report are Ernest I. Hennig (recent Concordia postdoctoral fellow); Tomas Soukup and Erika Orlitova (GISAT); Christian Schwick (Die Geographen schwick+spichtig); and Felix Kienast (Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research).

How can we find solutions to the world s pressing societal and environmental problems? One way is to provide free education on international issues on a global scale. So, beginning this fall, Concordia is teaming up with the United Nations to offer its first-ever Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), designed to help global citizens answer this sort of question.   Wicked Problems, Dynamic Solutions: The Ecosystem Approach and Systems Thinking   is an interdisciplinary course open to all. Anyone who is interested will have the opportunity to learn about complex ideas such as ecological resilience, environmental governance, urban biodiversity and the impact of climate change in an accessible way.  While there are many MOOCs out there that introduce ecosystem services and related topics, this is one of the first that focuses explicitly on the ecosystem approach, long adopted as desirable by the UN, while covering so many key ecosystems and overarching themes  explains Peter Stoett , director of the Loyola Sustainability Research Centre (LSRC). A Canadian first The Education Department of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi contacted Stoett last year about the possibility of setting up a MOOC together. He immediately set about securing the support of colleagues from across the university.  This is the first time Concordia has worked with the UN on a major online educational project,  Stoett says, adding that Concordia s partnership with UNEP on a large-scale MOOC is also a first for a Canadian university. The Department of Geography, Planning and Environment (GPE) will host the course, which will feature speakers from both GPE and LSRC, including Stoett and fellow researchers in the areas of environment and sustainability,   Damon Matthews , Annie Lalancette , Katja Neves, and Pascale Biron   all of whom helped to develop various aspects of the course. Concordia experts will be joined by international colleagues from UNEP in Nairobi and elsewhere.  We are very excited about this initiative and proud to be associated with a MOOC that has been so thoughtfully and collaboratively designed and developed,\" says Monica Mulrennan , Associate Professor and Chair of GPE. Always eager to provide Concordia students with exciting options,  Stoett and FAS Dean Andr  Roy ensured that the initiative will include a course credit option  ( GEOG 298   Selected Topics in Geography ), in a blended-learning format   partly online and partly in the classroom.  This will provide a greatly enriched opportunity for students to engage with the material they ve been exposed to through the MOOC and take it further,  says Mulrennan. Facilitating international dialogue The MOOC is being produced in partnership with KnowledgeOne, the digital learning developer for all of Concordia s online courses. CEO Robert Beauchemin says there was a steep learning curve involved, referring to the technical complexity of the powerful Open edX platform adopted for the course.  We are eager to step up to the challenge of seeing this project succeed.  For those wishing to take the online-only course, registration is free and open to all. A high-school level education is recommended.  The MOOC will provide the opportunity for students and professionals from across the world to interact,  says LSRC Co-ordinator Rebecca Tittler .  Participants will also be able to apply course material from their own geographic perspectives.  For example, the course includes interactive mapping exercises which ask students to post pictures from their neighbourhood and then link them to similar pictures from elsewhere. The course will also have an active online discussion board to facilitate international dialogue about the issues being taught.  Wicked Problems, Dynamic Solutions  was designed to be open to as many people as possible.  It is all about accessibility,  says Stoett.  Thousands of individuals from various age groups and backgrounds can take the course.  Available on your mobile One other crucial element   people can follow the course on their cell phones.  This is important because in many places around the world, cell phones may be a lot more accessible than computers,  explains Tittler. Both Mulrennan and Stoett agree it will be important to pay close attention to how this initial MOOC works in practice, in case the university wants to plan for more of them in the future.  The course is considered a pilot project this fall,  says Stoett.  After that, we will revisit the entire production and teaching process and strive to improve it.  For now, with registration up and running, enthusiasm for the course is high. The university is already committed to developing another UNEP-based MOOC for 2017, and discussions are ongoing around a third option.  We are certainly teaching for tomorrow with MOOCs and blended-learning approaches,  Stoett says.  But more importantly, we are teaching the basics of an ecosystem approach that will be vital to the survival of future generations.  Learn more about the course or register.  Concordia students wishing to take the blended course can register online via the MyConcordia portal.  The course begins on Monday, September 12.

How will we cope with rising sea levels and climbing temperatures? But it's not just humans who will be affected by these worldwide shifts   it's our closest cousins, too: monkeys, apes and lemurs. A new Concordia study published in the International Journal of Primatology shows that the world's primate populations may be seriously impacted by climate change. \"Our research shows that climate change may be one of the biggest emerging threats to primates, compounding existing pressures from deforestation, hunting and the exotic pet trade,\" says Tanya Graham, the article's lead author and an MSc student in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment . She worked with environment professor Damon Matthews from Concordia and primatology post-doctoral researcher Sarah Turner from McGill to assess the exposure and potential vulnerability of all non-human primate species to projected future temperature and precipitation changes. They found that overall, 419 species of non-human primates   such as various species of lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, monkeys and apes  will experience 10 per cent more warming than the global average, with some primate species experiencing increases of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in annual average temperature for every degree of global warming. The researchers also identified several hotspots of primate vulnerability to climate change, based on the combination of the number of species, their endangered status and the severity of climate changes at each location. Overall, the most extreme hotspots, which represent the upper 10 per cent of all hotspot scores, cover a total area of 3,622,012 square kilometres over the ranges of 67 primate species. The highest hotspot scores occur in Central America, the Amazon and southeastern Brazil, as well as portions of East and Southeast Asia   prime territory for some of the globe's best-known primates who call these areas home. The ursine howler monkey, black howler monkey, and barbary macaque are expected to be exposed to the highest magnitude of climate change when both temperature and precipitation are considered. For example, the ursine howler monkey, found in Venezuela, will experience an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius annually and a 5.3 per cent decline in annual rainfall for each degree of global temperature increase. \"This study highlights the vulnerability of individual species, as well as regions in which primates as a whole may be vulnerable to climate change,\" says Matthews, who will present the findings of this study during the Joint Meeting of the International Primatological Society and the American Society of Primatologists in Chicago later this month. \"Our findings can be taken as priorities for ongoing conservation efforts, given that any success in decreasing other current human pressures on endangered species may also increase that species  ability to withstand the growing pressures of climate changes,  says Graham.  Primates are often seen as flagship species for entire ecosystems, so conservation can have important ramifications for many other species too. I hope our study will help direct conservation efforts for individual primate species in particular, but also for vulnerable ecosystems in general throughout the tropical regions inhabited by non-human primates,\" adds Turner.

Damon Matthews:  A fantastic opportunity.  This is the question to which Damon Matthews , Concordia University Research Chair for Climate Science and Sustainability and professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment , has dedicated himself for well over a decade. Considered a leader in his field, Matthews researches climate systems, climate change and environmental modelling. Now this work has earned him a top national honour   membership in the Royal Society of Canada s College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists . Formed in 2014 to recognize intellectual leaders and pioneers in Canada from a variety of fields, the college already boasts the membership of four Concordia researchers   Steven High , Erin Manning and Vincent Martin were included in the inaugural cohort, and Muthukumaran Packirisamy was inducted last year. Matthews is immensely honoured to represent Concordia within the college.  This is a fantastic opportunity to meet and interact with a group of really interesting young scholars and researchers,  Matthews says.  I m especially grateful to Concordia for their role in putting my nomination forward   this university has been a wonderful environment in which to build my academic career, and I would like to thank the many people here who have supported me both personally and professionally.  Through his research, Matthews has shown how each emission of carbon dioxide leads to a discrete and essentially irreversible increase in world temperatures. This work has improved understandings of the science of climate change, its impacts on human and environmental systems and how best to respond to the challenge of climate mitigation.  Recognition from a prestigious body like the Royal Society of Canada is extremely gratifying,  says Graham Carr, interim provost and vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.  The fact that Concordia faculty members continue to receive this honour is a further demonstration of the important contributions that our research makes to the betterment of Canadian society.  Concordia is also the institutional sponsor of the College, a tribute to the university's commitment to next-generation researchers.

Concordia professor  Zachary Patterson  is teaming up with the City of Montreal to launch MTLTrajet , a mobile app that will help the city learn more about how its citizens navigate from point A to point B.  I wanted to be able to undertake transportation and land-use research using emerging data sources,  says Patterson, an associate professor of geography, planning and environment in the  Faculty of Arts and Science.  However, getting ahold of this kind of data proved difficult. So, using smartphones, I developed an app to collect my own data.  DataMobile The app initially launched as  DataMobile , a 2014 pilot project. Close to 900 people downloaded the app, which prompted them to take part in a survey before it recorded their trips throughout the day using their smartphone. Developed at Concordia s  TRIP Lab , the app asked users for information such as their purpose of travel and chosen mode of transport.  Its purpose was to test how well we can use smartphones to collect travel data for transportation planning purposes,  says Patterson. The app proved popular, and was used in studies as far away as Ghana. Closer to home, it will be used in five Canadian cities   Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax   as part of this fall's  Canada Food Study . MTLTrajet The City of Montreal became interested when Patterson was a mentor at  MTL Cycle Challenge  (MCC), an initiative designed to improve cycling in the city by using data sets to create urban mobility solutions. At MCC, Patterson discussed the DataMobile project with representatives from the city's transport department and the  Montr al, Smart City  initiative.  The city is very enthusiastic about the adoption of new technologies in transport-related data collection,  says Patterson. After he was invited to give a presentation on DataMobile for city officials, they asked him to use it as the basis of MTLTrajet. In advance of its October 17 launch, the app is already generating plenty of buzz, on the streets and at City Hall.  It has been great working with the city,  says Patterson.  Converting data to information How will the results help advance Patterson s research? MTLTrajet will help Patterson and other researchers  figure out how to convert mere data to information.   It s a potentially effective tool because almost everyone carries around smartphones that know where they are, which can collect crucial transportation data,  says Patterson. He emphasizes the app s data collection is transparent.  The process is completely overt, so that respondents will know what data is being collected from them.  In the long term, Patterson s goal is to gather enough data to develop algorithms that will make it unnecessary to have any user input at all. Additional studies are already being planned by the University of Toronto, the  Institut national de recherche scientifique  s Montreal office, the  Agence m tropolitaine de transport ,  BIXI , the  STM  and the  Quebec  Ministry of Transport .  A travel survey collection effort is also being developed in Lahore, Pakistan. So, if you ve spent your summer playing Pok mon GO and are craving a new smartphone pastime while out and about, MTLTrajet may just be your new fall fix.  They both operate on smartphones and keep track of the location of the phone,  admits Patterson.  But it is different, in that it's not a game   and uses less battery, I hope!  MTLTrajet launches on October 17.

How does the public space surrounding the downtown campus define us as a university community? This is a question addressed in the eighth instalment of the Quartier Concordia series , currently exhibited in the vitrines of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV). Public Spaces and Gathering Places highlights the creation of Norman Bethune Square as a gathering point for numerous rallies, the use of Mackay Street as a concert ground and the recent development of Zone  ducation Culture on Bishop Street. Clarence Epstein, senior director of Urban and Cultural Affairs at Concordia, points out that people have come together around the university   in Stanley Cup parades, demonstrations, performances and cultural events   mostly in spaces not designed as gathering places.  Following the construction of Cabot Square in the late 19th century, very little priority was given to public space planning,  he says.  What we recognize as gathering places have appeared as a result of the way the neighbourhood has evolved. They ve been appropriated by the various people and organizations who live in and occupy these spaces.   Proactive changes  Now, the planning of new public areas is a priority for the city s administration and local stakeholders, including the university. In tandem with the new exhibition, Concordia joined with the City of Montreal s Department of Public Works to launch a visioning charrette to engage the entire community in determining the future of the alley that runs south of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) between Mackay and Bishop streets. A charrette is a participatory design program allowing professionals, scholars and students to join community stakeholders in discussing and visualizing the possibilities for an urban space.  We understand from the City of Montreal that this space is going to change,  Epstein says, noting that municipal officials have also placed a reserve on an adjacent parcel of land slated for a park at the corner of Mackay and Ste-Catherine streets.  The goal of the charrette and other initiatives like it is to inform good design decisions through collective reflection and communication.  The LB Alley charrette took place on October 21 and 22 in the LB atrium, J.A. DeS ve Cinema and in the alley itself. The public was invited to engage in  planning-in-situ,  with walks-through, video-photographic analysis and community sketches. Discussions were led by Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor of geography, planning and environment in the Faculty of Arts and Science . He says the process encourages the public to plan spaces for themselves   from the spaces, because they are the ultimate users. From Modernism to democratization De la Llata explains that in the first half of the 20th century, the dominant approach to urban planning was Modernism, in which form followed the function architects believed spaces should have, rather than the way they were actually used. Modernist planners felt they knew best how people should behave, and built cities designed to coerce citizens into using spaces as they intended them to. According to De la Llata, this resulted in a wide array of urban planning disasters.  Modernist planning transformed cities in a way that wasn t very democratic,  he says.  The motivation here is democratization. We want to understand what qualities people want to see in the space, and to give a chance to Montrealers, the Concordia community, St. Jax Church, McKibbins Irish Pub and other restaurants and businesses on the periphery of the alley to participate in the planning and design of the space.

Damon Matthews is a geography, planning and environment professor and Concordia University Research Chair (Climate Science and Sustainability) in the Faculty of Arts and Science . Following the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on November 4, Matthews co-authored* an op-ed about what it will take for Canada to uphold its commitment to combatting climate change. The Paris Agreement was ratified earlier this month and is unprecedented amongst international agreements for how quickly it has come into force. This agreement allows each country to decide how it will tackle climate change and requires, as of 2020, regular reporting on progress. Countries of the world have officially embarked on a global race to implement ambitious climate policies that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the planetary scale. This process is not unlike the Olympic Games where countries get together to compare their strengths and performance. If Canada wants to be a medalist in 2020, domestic climate policies must rapidly be adopted to accelerate the low carbon transition. In this context, Sustainable Canada Dialogues   a network of 60+ scholars from across Canada   produced a progress report on the country s climate actions over the past year. We analyzed climate decisions made in Ottawa in 2016 in relationship to the 10 policy orientations that we proposed previously in our position paper entitled Acting on Climate Change: Solutions from Canadian Scholars . Canada took two important steps forward. First, the federal government will price carbon throughout the country starting in 2018. Second, the $120 billion infrastructure investment plan explicitly highlights support for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This investment plan raises hopes that Canada can make the transition to low carbon development, but its real impact depends on identifying and funding infrastructure projects that best contribute to desired low-carbon and sustainable outcomes. Despite this progress, the decision to approve the Pacific NorthWest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is a step backward, casting doubt on the willingness of the federal government to meaningfully tackle climate change. The impact assessment indicates that this LNG project would be one of the largest point source of emissions in Canada and would increase British Columbia s emissions by 8.5 per cent. Continued development of projects with high greenhouse gas emissions will compromise progress in other sectors. It will prevent Canada from meeting its emissions reduction target for 2030, and is incompatible with Canada s stated goal to help limit global temperature increases to 1.5oC. Research indeed estimates that, to maintain global temperature increase below 2oC, half of existing gas reserves and one third of existing oil ones must remain unused. Canadian climate policy must tackle the most difficult question: how to transition away from fossil fuels? We call for federal political leadership that steadily and strategically adopts innovative low-carbon tools to drive future economic growth. This requires engaging with a broad range of stakeholders from the oil and gas industry, unions, Indigenous peoples, environmental NGOs, the clean technology sector and academia to discuss how to reorient subsidies away from the fossil fuel industry, promote transitions to low-carbon energy, while ensuring that workers from the oil and gas industry can transition their skills to other sectors. Ambitious Canadian climate leadership is necessary more than ever in North America. Only by working together and building commitment across all sectors will Canada live up to the expectations it rose by joining the High Ambition Coalition in 2015. Despite positive steps, the federal government has been unable so far to develop a coherent climate action plan largely because of its inability to address fossil fuels coherently.

That s what faculty members and community representatives will team up to discuss at the next Beyond Disciplines event, taking place Thursday, December 1, on Concordia s Loyola Campus. Organized by Andr  Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS), in collaboration with the Office of Community Engagement, the series examines the role of mutual learning in research. Building bridges/Going beyond the walls will pair FAS faculty members and the community representatives they work with. Chedly Belkhodja , professor and principal of the School of Community and Public Affairs, is hosting the event.  Engaging with community is at the heart of what we do at the school,  he says.  It s wonderful to see the dean has chosen this topic.  Ann-Louise Davidson , an associate professor in Education, concurs.  The research we do is not contained inside the physical walls of the university.  The post-event reception will be hosted by Loyola s Hive Caf  Co-op , which serves a free sustainable lunch for the Loyola community every weekday. Attendees will also get to check out an art project facilitated by La Ruche d'Art NDG Art Hive .  We are thrilled to be participating. It s going to be a lot of fun,  says the Hive Caf  Co-op s events coordinator Paige Hilderman. The speakers include Davidson and her colleague, assistant professor  Giuliana Cucinelli , as well as Chris Colley and Christine Truesdale of LEARN Quebec , a group that helps minorities in the province s school system. Together they will discuss maker culture in an educational context.  Going beyond the walls means engaging in discussions to see how we can build synergies through concrete activities where true collaboration can exist,  Davidson says.  We are conducting research in a living lab. We might not all be playing the same roles, but we can speak to each other.  Eva Pomeroy , a lecturer in Applied Human Sciences, will be joined by C dric Jamet, a partner from percolab . Jamet co-designed and co-facilitated the Concordia ULab Social Innovation Hub , an experiment in transformative education that was launched this fall.  There is such incredible potential in partnering with the community,  says Pomeroy.  We can continuously co-create learning that is aligned with the needs of the world outside the university in the present moment.    Also at the December 1 event,  Anna-Liisa Aunio , an adjunct professor with the Loyola College for Diversity and Sustainability, will discuss her research on food justice sustainability with Ga lle Janvier of Alternatives Montreal. Monica Mulrennan , chair of the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment, will outline her work with Northern Cree populations alongside deputy grand chief Rodney Mark .  Meanwhile, Varda Mann-Feder , also in Applied Human Sciences, will profile her partnership with C.A.R.E. Jeunesse , an organization that helps youth who are transitioning out of government care. For Mann-Feder, community collaboration has been a transformative experience.  These young people have thrived against all odds and are the embodiment of resilience. It is very humbling for me as a researcher to work alongside them.  Beyond Disciplines: Building bridges/Going beyond the walls takes place at 5 p.m. on Thursday, December 1, in Room 110.00 of the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics (GE) on Concordia s Loyola Campus (7141 Sherbrooke St. W.).

This course provides an introduction to the basic set of planning tools available to the practicing planner. Planning practice is situated within the context of the Canadian constitution and the provincial Quebec planning law, the Land Use Planning and Development Act (LUPDA). The course is divided into topical areas relevant to urban and regional planning. Law and regulations in land use control are discussed, including official RCM plans (regional planning), local plans (local planning), revision of plans and interim control, local zoning bylaws, subdivision bylaws, discretionary planning tools (variance, holding zones, site plans, spot zoning and incentive zoning), and public participation and grounds for judicial review of municipal actions. The final part of the course adopts amore critical perspective on land-use regulation, exploring how it has been exploited to sustain the interests of the powerful in contemporary society. URBS 300: Neighbourhood & Community Planning.  This course examines theories, issues and techniques of community-level planning in urban and suburban environments. Particular place-based or identity based communities and their participation in planning processes are considered. Models of community change and local development are reviewed along with the policies and supportive infrastructure in cities, including Montreal. Local governance, decision-making, and public participation are considered in light of municipal and regional institutions which currently predominate in Canada s metropolitan areas. URBS 450: Urban Economic Restructuring.  The course provides a review of contemporary theories on the socio-spatial, organizational and political implications of the economic restructuring of advanced capitalist economies, supplemented with empirical case studies, with a particular focus on Western inner-cities. Particular attention will be paid to policies adopted at the municipal level to try and mitigate economic difficulties associated with economic restructuring, as well as shifts in municipal governance implicit in this wider transition. URBS 498 N: Planning Property & Neighbourhood Change.  This course provides an overview of the political and economic forces shaping neighbourhood change, supplemented with empirical case studies, with a particular focus on Western inner-cities. Particular attention will be paid to planning policies adopted at the municipal level to navigate the transition from managerial to entrepreneurial cities and how local neighbourhood changes are embedded within wider political-economic currents. Past Courses: URBS 260 - Analytical Methods in Urban Studies.  This course explores research methods and processes, especially as they relate to planning and public policy.

Most Significant Career Research Contributions Peopling of a North American City: Montreal 1840-1900 McGill-Queens Press 2011. This book is the culmination of 20 years of research on 19th century Montreal. Historical demographers have shied away from studying complex urban populations because of their size and mobility but through the lens of twelve surnames our \"miniature Montreal\" tracks over 60 years about one individual in two hundred. Their experiences allows us to identify three skeins of continuity, three patterns of choice, and in the timing of their marriages, births, deaths, and moves, three demographic regimes. Despite continual exchange and some intermarriage among French Canadians, Irish Catholics and Anglo-Protestants, each reproduced themselves in quite different ways and points to the existence of three quite distinct demographic systems and strategies, which persisted over the three or four generations, undermining  presumptions of cultural \"assimilation\" of migrants. Our findings force us to question certain other interpretations in the literature of the North American city, to make a case for the importance of family and kin in understanding social change, and to assert rather vigorously the importance of \"cultural difference\" in demographic analysis. Down to 1900 there is little evidence of a sanitary or epidemiological transition in Montreal but we do see the beginnings of a fertility transition. Stability is most impressive with respect to the inequalities of voice, purchasing power, and access to real property, but upward social mobility is apparent among second and third generation French and Irish and all groups adjusted in response to rapid growth and industrial transformation. People were responding in a variety of ways to a wide range of circumstances. They were operating in contexts of intense personal mobility - geographic and social, long-distance, local, or around the corner. Even in very tight circumstances, individuals were making choices, sometimes conscious, sometimes intuitive, and we argue that their experiences with moving sharpened their awareness of the space for maneuver, and promoted a calculus of choice and agency. Mortality in late nineteenth-century Montreal : Geographic pathways of contagion. Population Studies 65(2) 201 pp.157-181. In the City of Montreal, 1881, the presence of three cultural communities with different profiles of economic status makes it possible to observe the way social settings affected survival over a lifetime. Regression models show culturally determined maternal factors dominant for infants, and persistent throughout childhood. For post-neonates, children aged 1 4, and adults aged 15 59 household poverty has a comparable effect. Among adults, a gender penalty differs among the three communities. Models are improved when differentiated by cause of death. Locating households using a GIS reveals high levels of residential segregation by ethnicity and income, spatial correlation of environmental hazards, and constraints on exit from zones of risk, which together produce neighbourhood effects as large as household effects. Attention to groups excluded (foundlings and inmates of institutions) confirms that models limited to full household-level information significantly underestimate the impacts of poverty and exclusion. \"Dimensions sociales de la mortalit  infantile   Montr al au milieu       du 19e si cle\" Annales de Demographie Historique, 1988:299-325; \"A Deadly       Discrimination among Montreal Infants, 1860-1900\" Continuity and Change       16(1) 2001:95-135. These are the first and last papers from a project on infant mortality       in 19th century Montreal. This was the first scientific research on 19th       century infant mortality in Canada based on linking three birth cohorts       (1860, 1880, 1900) to deaths, census and taxrolls. About a quarter of infants       died before their first birthday, with no improvement over the period. Half       died of diarrhea in the summer, testament to the appalling sanitary conditions       in industrial cities - the \"urban penalty\". Cultural identity rather than       class or habitat was key to differences in mortality levels in the city.       The impact of filth was mediated by cultural behaviour (short birth intervals,       premature weaning and early artificial supplementation). Ultimately, we       argue that municipal government, founded upon the fiscal privileges and       liabilities of property owners, and interactions of cultural and social \"difference\" exerted a lethal discrimination among infants. \"The Problem of Out-Migration from Atlantic Canada, 1871-1921: A New       Look.\" The Acadiensis Reader: Volume Two: Canada Since Confederation. Fredericton:       Acadiensis Press. This paper first appeared as the lead article in Acadiensis in 1985. Since       then it has been reprinted in the 2nd (1988) and 3rd (1999) editions of       the Acadiensis Reader on Post Confederation Canada. It contains the first       estimates of net out-migration, by age and sex, county by county and argues       theoretically and empirically why outmigration may have been the cause rather       than the consequence of economic decline in the Maritimes. It highlights       the role of women in 19th and early 20th century migration. I was asked       to extend this analysis to the whole of Eastern Canada for Vol 2. Historical       Atlas of Canada (1993), the plate was reproduced in the Concise version       of the Atlas in 1998. I was approached to write an overview on the Exodus       for all of Canada for the CD-ROM Post Confederation History Reader (2001). \"The Challenge of the Irish Catholic Community in Nineteenth-century       Montreal.\" Social History 35(70) 333-64. This paper has been (2006) reprinted       in People, Places and Times: Canadian Social History Reader. Vol.1: Pre-Confederation. Using high quality parish records, micro-census data and city taxrolls,       combined with secondary sources we trace the destinies of Irish Catholics       who settled in the 1840s. We argue that Montreal offered an exceptional       context of a Catholic majority, a bilingual labour market and in the 1840s       a polity undergoing reconstruction, which provided them unique opportunities       for separate identity formation and social and economic advancement. We       demonstrate that the \"famine immigrants\" advanced from labourers into new       economic niches, their infants thrived, they achieved in the second and       third generations substantial improvement in housing and residential integration,       and an active political voice. These findings contradict earlier assumptions       of poverty, powerlessness and exclusion and raise new questions about urban       opportunities and social pathways. \"The Religious Claim on Babies in nineteenth century Montreal\" in R.       Derosas and F. van Poppel (eds) Religion and the decline of fertility in       the Western World. (Springer, 2006) pages 207-234. This is the first attempt to calculate standard fertility measures for       19th century Canada by matching births from parish registers to their mothers       in the census. It uses the newly available \"100%\" data for 1881. We argue       that we must extend our interpretation of fertility in the \"demographic       transition\" to embrace all behaviors that affect rates of reproduction (marriage       or starting behaviour as well as marital fertility or spacing and stopping       behaviour). Marriage was a prime demographic regulator differing more profoundly       among cultural and economic groups than marital fertility. From a set of       logistic regressions we demonstrate the impact of economic and cultural       variables on entering into marriage and on having a baby. Age and proportions       married were strongly influenced by country of origin - Ireland, England,       Scotland, France - and economic success and aspirations exerted a strong       impact on marrying and some impact on having a next child. We discuss the       ways religious differences may have contributed to the persistence of distinct       demographic regimes and the stubborn coexistence in a single city of distinct       understandings of family, distinct expectations of married life, and distinct       aspirations of being grown-up.

Road effects model for predicting when animal populations are at risk from roads: an interactive model of road avoidance behaviour - Click here to start the model - Roads and traffic affect animal populations detrimentally in four ways: they decrease habitat amount and quality, enhance mortality due to collisions with vehicles, prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and subdivide animal populations into smaller and more vulnerable fractions. Roads will affect persistence of animal populations differently depending on (1) road avoidance behavior of the animals (i.e., noise avoidance, road surface avoidance, and car avoidance); (2) population sensitivity to the four road effects; (3) road size; and (4) traffic volume. We have created a model based on these population and road characteristics to study the questions: (1) what types of road avoidance behaviors make populations more vulnerable to roads?; (2) what types of roads have the greatest impact on population persistence?; and (3) how much does the impact of roads vary with the relative population sensitivity to the four road effects? Our results suggest that, in general, the most vulnerable populations are those with high noise and high road surface avoidance, and secondly, those with high noise avoidance only. Conversely, the least vulnerable populations are those with high car avoidance only, and secondly, high road surface and high car avoidance. Populations with low overall road avoidance and those with high overall road avoidance tend to respond in opposite ways when the sensitivity to the four road effects is varied. The same is true of populations with high road surface avoidance when compared to those with high car and high noise avoidance. The model further predicted that traffic volume has a larger effect than road size on the impact of roads on population persistence. One potential application of our model is to generate predictions for more structured field studies of road avoidance behavior and its influence on persistence of wildlife populations.

What are the objectives of environmental science? Dr. Martin Scheringer and I want to start a critical discussion of this question. Therefore, we investigate the kinds of research questions asked by environmental scientists. To do this, we are taking a closer look at four questions: What is the lack of knowledge to be addressed by the research? What is the purpose of the results? What are the subjects the research is dealing with? What are the methods chosen for the investigation? We propose that problem-oriented environmental science should strive to find answers to these questions that are different from those offered by  classical  natural sciences. The reason is that in the treatment of environmental problems, there is often a discrepancy between the needs of dicision makers and the results provided by scientific research (what we call the  datadilemma ). To explore how this discrepancy could be reduced, we make a distinction between knowledge-oriented and decision-oriented reduction of complexity. The challenge that today's environmental research is facing is that decision-oriented reduction of complexity should be incorporated in the selection of scientific problems. We use the guiding principle of  reflexive environmental research  and point out how it differs from the guiding principles of  classical scientific research . Its key elements are: reflection of guiding ideas external to science (e.g., sustainability); addressing explicitly the uncertainty and openness of scientific results and forecasts (including unknown unknowns); transdisciplinarity; the aim of contributing to the solution of complex and controversial real-world problems; adherence to relevant scientific standards.

Environmental geography is the branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the dynamics of climatology, hydrology, biogeography, geology and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment. Environmental geography represents a critically important set of analytical tools for assessing the impact of human presence on the environment by measuring the result of human activity on natural landforms and cycles. This program draws on courses within physical geography, including a distinctive strand of courses dealing with environmental issues, resources and management. Teaching and learning methods are diverse, ranging from lectures and tutorials through to a variety of practical work in cartography, GIS, remote sensing and statistics. Environmental geographers are familiar with how natural systems function, but they also know that humans are a dominant agent of change in nature. They realize that it is not possible to understand environmental problems without understanding the physical processes as well as the demographic, cultural, and economic processes that lead to increased resource consumption and waste. Environmental geographers fan out along a variety of academic paths, and these paths will cross, mingle, or converge with those of other disciplines. By its very nature geography is a discipline that seeks to integrate and synthesize knowledge. Therein lies its strength. The geographer s world is your world: it is the earth as the home of humans. Why study environmental geography? Environmental geography prepares students for careers in environmental planning, design, and restoration, as well as in environmental assessment and monitoring, resource management, natural areas preservation, and outdoor and environmental education. Students completing the program will develop competencies in a broad array of subjects spanning the natural and social sciences, as well as complementary analytical techniques. Environmental geographers ask a diverse set of questions such as: Can the global environment cope with anticipated population growth? What will be the extent and impact of global warming? Should we protect tropical forests and why are they being destroyed? What causes famine and why do people die from it? Should we allow Hydro Quebec to dam the rivers entering James Bay? Much of what happens in our daily lives is influenced by events beyond our  local world    events often beyond our borders and outside the control of our national governments. As the world s nations and environment become more interdependent, the need to understand how our lives are interconnected across the globe increases. With it the role of geography and employment opportunities for geographers will continue to grow.

Geography is a point of view, a particular way of looking at and thinking about the earth. It is the questions that geography asks about places, landscapes, and the environment that distinguish it from other subdivisions of knowledge. Geography is a broad and diverse discipline that examines interrelationships and interconnections, while stressing synthesis, a worthy goal of scholarship, given the lingering penchant for reductionism and ever finer divisions of knowledge. Geographers are familiar with how natural systems function; they know that humans are a dominant agent of change in nature; they are interested in the attitudes, values, and ideas that cultural groups attach to their surroundings; they have a heritage of thinking about plants, animals, people, and the environment as an inseparable complex; and they have long been interested in the areal association and spatial organization of both natural and anthropogenic phenomena on the earth's surface. As a result, geography is well-placed to act as a bridge between the social sciences and humanities on the one hand and the physical and biological sciences on the other. From such a central position, it is inevitable that geographers fan out along a variety of academic paths, and that these paths will cross, mingle, or converge with those of other disciplines. By its very nature geography is a discipline that seeks to integrate and synthesize knowledge. Therein lies its strength. The geographer's world is your world: it is the earth as the home of humans. Why study geography? Because we need to identify and analyze the global, regional, and local structures and processes that affect our daily lives. Because as the world becomes more interdependent, the need for the integrative geographical perspective will increase. Because trying to make sense of the world is an endlessly exciting challenge. Geographers ask a diverse set of questions such as: Can the global environment cope with anticipated population growth? What will be the extent and impact of global warming? Should we protect tropical forests and why are they being destroyed? What causes famine and why do people die from it? Why and where do people migrate or flee? Should we allow Hydro Quebec to dam the rivers entering James Bay? Much of what happens in our daily lives is influenced by events beyond our  local world    events often beyond our borders and outside the control of our national governments.

All Honours students must write a thesis and register for the Honours Thesis course (either GEOG 491 or URBS 491). The Honours thesis can be considered as a \"trial run\" for a graduate thesis. Applying for Honours An application for transfer into an Honours program is typically made in May, and the Honours Thesis course begins in September. Admission into Honours requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 on a 4.3 scale, no grade lower than a C, and the agreement of a full-time or affiliated assistant professor to supervise the Honours thesis research. An undergraduate advisor submits an electronic application on the applicant's behalf once the academic year is complete at the end of April, and the transfer to Honours is decided by a committee in the Faculty of Arts and Science administration. Once the transfer has been made, the student should seek academic advising for changes to their registration. Usually they will take the 6-credit Honours course, GEOG 491 or URBS 491, beginning in the fall of their final academic year. Some students are given automatic admission into an Honours program, but they must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 to enroll in GEOG 491 or URBS 491. In the second-to-last year of your program, you should start thinking about what research topic you would be interested in investigating, and which full-time or affiliated assistant professor could supervise your project. One good way to start is to look at the web pages of the faculty members in the department  (http://www.gpe.concordia.ca/research/) . You will be able to see the type of research conducted by your professors, and you will see their latest publications. Some professors have already thought of projects that they would like Honours students to investigate, so you can also ask professors if they have ideas for you. Summer Work To Get You Prepared One great way of getting to know what type of research is undertaken in the Department is to work as a research assistant during the summer. If you have a strong GPA and you are in the B.Sc. program (or if you are interested in working on a natural science project), you can apply for the Undergraduate Student Research Scholarships ( USRA ) from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). Note that the professor needs to hold a grant from NSERC in order to supervise your USRA. In addition, there is a new  pilot program at Concordia  that is the equivalent of NSERC USRA. Otherwise, you can approach your professor either in class or by e-mail and ask if he/she has research funds to hire an undergraduate student for the summer. In many cases, Honours students have used their summer work in the Department to start collecting their data for their Honours thesis. Honours Thesis Course In the Honours Thesis course, students are expected to complete original research under supervision. The scope of the project will be decided between each student and his/her supervisor. It is anticipated that students will emerge from the program with basic skills in formulating and testing hypotheses, experimental design, data analysis and presentation, critical evaluation of published work and scientific writing; all of the skills required of a good graduate student. It is not essential that the project produce positive results leading to clear, definitive conclusions. Projects may yield negative results or no clear results at all. This is the nature of scientific research. It is expected, however, that each project will address a clearly defined research question and that students will learn much about the scientific method in the process of completing the project. The mark in this course will be assigned based on the quality of the two oral presentations and the written thesis which is evaluated by the instructor of the course, the supervisor and an external reader from the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment. Thinking about graduate studies Early in your final year in the BA or BSc Honours program, you may wish to start thinking about graduate studies. There are several external scholarships available for research-based Master's programs both in social science (Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) at the federal level, and Fonds de Recherche Qu bec Soci t  Culture (FRQSC) at the provincial level) and natural science (Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) at the federal level and Fonds de Recherche Qu bec - Nature et Technologies (FRQNT) at the provincial level). These scholarships are highly competitive (minimum GPA of 3.7/4.3), but they offer a minimum level of funding of $15,000 per year. The deadline to submit your application is usually in October for a scholarship starting the following academic year.

Changes of land use often take place as small-scale individual measures considered insignificant by themselves. However, by spatial and temporal accumulation they can lead to significant changes in the regional structure and in the environmental conditions. Substantial goals of the research of the Leibniz Institute of Ecological Urban and Regional Development (IOER) are the development of methods for the detection of land-use changes and for the description of this development by indicators as well as the analysis and evaluation of the effects of such processes on selected environmental protection goods.

Example topics are the relationship between group rationality and individual rationality, the epistemic significance of disagreement, the difficulties for testing hypotheses in the social sciences, the impact of social structures on biological notions such as race, and the ethical considerations surrounding how race is used in science and society It has become common practice within the economic literature on climate change to model the problem of international greenhouse gas emissions game-theoretically as a so-called \"Tragedy of the Commons\".  If this choice of model is the correct one, we're in trouble the conditions under which such commons problems have historically been solved  are almost entirely absent in the case of international greenhouse gas emissions. While I believe that this model will support many accurate predictions, I don't believe this is necessarily a cause for concern. In this essay, I will argue that the predictive accuracy of the tragedy model stems from the model's ability to make self-fulfilling predictions within our current international setting. Each nation's expectation of self-interested actions on the parts of other members in the game, in effect, modifies each nation's behavior. I present some recent work in behavioral economics that offers a glimmer of hope. In particular, individuals don't typically act in what such models consider to be rationally self-interested ways. A call for nations to act irrationally,  much like we all seem to do, may well be our best promise in solving the climate problem.

Prison-Based Resistance and the Diffusion of Activism in Palestine January 30, 2015, 12 p.m.   1:30 p.m. The question of how Palestinians should engage with the Israeli legal system is complicated for prisoners and detainees, whose current and future situations, both individual and collective, are inherently intertwined with that system. From the early days of the occupation, in addition to pursuing traditional justice mechanisms, prisoners have engaged in acts of extra-legal resistance, aimed at making the prison system itself unworkable. Actions have included the development of alternative institutions (such as political, financial, and educational systems within the prisons), noncooperation (such as refusing to comply with prison protocols), and prolonged hunger strikes. Such acts of resistance have had a reverberating effect, diffusing beyond the temporal and spatial boundaries of the physical prison institutions to influence policy and inspire local, national, and international activism. In this presentation, Dr. Julie Norman discusses the short and long term impacts of prison-based resistance among activist networks, examining how hunger strikes in particular resonate in unique ways from other forms of activism. Her findings are based primarily on personal interviews with former political prisoners and current activists in the West Bank. ","title":"Prisoners Dilemma?

Not only do interpretations vary along literary, political, class, gender, and racial lines, but a wider range of literary genres are being considered.

There is growing concern about the uncontrolled spread of residential, commercial and industrial areas, which is commonly called urban sprawl. In order to develop strategies to monitor and control urban sprawl, it is essential to know its drivers and its current state. Europe is a densely build-up continent and its diversity provides the ideal region to study urban sprawl and its potential drivers. In this study, we quantified urban sprawl in 39 European countries (excl. city states) at regional level using the classification of Nomenclature of Territorial Statistics (NUTS-2). We analyzed the role and importance of demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental drivers at the same level using Ridge Regression. We show that population density, road and railway density, and governmental effectiveness are the most important drivers of urban sprawl in Europe at the NUTS-2 level. Household size and the number of cars owned per person are less important, but play also a significant role in driving urban sprawl. These results suggest a focus on the demographic development and the development of the infrastructure in the first place in order to control urban sprawl. Additionally, political actions should take measures against urban sprawl into account when considering ways to increase prosperity. Finally, the life style should be directed towards a more sustainable development of settlement areas by making single-family dwellings less attractive and public transport services more attractive.

During these years, over sixty women visited a private home, to plant a tree or shrub in a carefully designed arboretum. This field of trees was intended to be a living monument to women who had either fought for the right to vote in the streets of England, or who had undergone hunger strikes and force-feeding in prison. The \"Suffragettes' Wood\" (also called \"Annie's Arboretum\" after the famous working-class suffragette, Annie Kenney) is the only known example of collective feminist landscape design in England. It is, however, one of many forms of feminist spatial occupation during the same period. In 1965 the Suffragettes' Wood was destroyed to make way for a housing estate, leaving few material traces behind. Fortunately, an extensive photographic archive survived, and was made public, digitally, in 2008. It was this archive that alerted Cynthia Hammond to this powerful feminist history in Bath, and led to her research-creation work, \"The Suffragettes' Orchard.\" Her presentation will tell the story of the Suffragettes' Wood, its creation, decline, and destruction.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract The region known as the Lower North Shore (LNS) consists of sixteen small communities spread along 400 km of coastline in northeastern Qu bec, Canada. Prompted by the collapse of its cod-fishing industry in the 1990s, the region has turned to place-branding strategies to encourage wilderness tourism as a form of economic renewal. This research creation thesis examines rubus chamaemorus, or the cloudberry, a local wild berry, as a contested cultural symbol in this process. The research question guiding this thesis asks: what are the effects of representations that are being used in efforts to stimulate economic development on the Lower North Shore of Qu bec? In particular, I analyze how the cloudberry is being used as a symbol of wilderness and purity in current place-branding projects in the region. This image perpetuates a frontier myth that the land is empty and available for privatization. The persistence of this narrative is shown across a history of similar settler colonial projects that use wilderness as a trope to justify so-called  development  of Indigenous land. This thesis argues furthermore that a relational approach to the cloudberry challenges its representation as a fixed  object , understanding it instead as a nexus of lived relations that include a range of practices such as walking, cooking and camping, and a host of competing interests such as Concordia University, Universit  Laval, local development centres on the LNS, as well as Anglophone, Francophone and Innu communities there. Through storytelling, the significance of cloudberries in everyday life on the coast is foregrounded, thus indicating social and environmental forms of well-being that should be respected and encouraged in various partnerships that are currently being negotiated there. This research has involved building an immersive, interactive installation using projection mapping and voice recognition software. Manifest Cloudberry Dreams is a portable 16  dome that serves both to archive and share video-recorded stories about harvesting and culinary practices using cloudberries on the LNS. These stories are vital counterpoints to dominant representations of the region as depressed, undeveloped, and dying. Where Room H-1001-01, Henry F.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract My thesis explores the processes of gaining deep knowledge about place through everyday travel. I focus on how different modes of mobility perform different kinds of spaces, views, and mental maps of the city, how the repetition of the daily routine enacts a personal archive of place, and how the functionalistic commute can be  detoured  into a meaningful practice. My creative research stems in part from my autoethnographic media practices of navigating the city, and frames the gathering of knowledge as an artistic experience that is integral to my methods of investigation. The commute is a unique and everyday liminal space, one that is ripe for artistic encounters and stories to materialize the city in transformative ways. By explicitly advocating an interventionist practice through mapping and locative art, I hope to contribute to the development of a more engaged commute as a hybrid space of pleasure and surprise. This project investigates three different and specific kinds of commutes. The first involves a walk between two very different neighbourhoods that involves crossing the controversial border that is the L Acadie Fence. I use cultural landscape methods of  reading  the built environment with an eye on the material, the social and the historical, as well as a photographic practice that documents and archives my daily journeys around the two neighbourhoods. The second commute relates the experience of city transit as a unique space of performance, both in the everyday ritual sense and as a space of social theatre. The ubiquity of mobile media in transit spaces is also addressed as having the potential to reconnect to one s surroundings, rather than disconnecting from the commuting routine. Finally, the third commute describes a drive from one city to another in rush hour traffic, combined with a look at Mikhail Bakhtin s chronotope as a method of cinematic analysis, and a way of discerning narratives that build up around the non-places of the auto-commute. This study will then conclude by presenting a framework for the detour as a practice of creative mapping through everyday travel. Where Room LB-646, J.W.

This case study can take different forms such as an in depth analysis of data collected (e.g. questionnaire survey, interviews, or measurement of some pollutant); a critical reflection on a specific policy; a comparative analysis of different topics, different contexts or difference in case studies. the research question(s) or study objective(s) or hypothesis/-es that you are planning to address (how does it relate to the theoretical framework chosen?; what is the time frame of the study?; what qualifies as empirical evidence?; how is empirical evidence observed/collected?; how will the data be analyzed?; or in what way(s) will these observations be reflected?); a brief review of the theoretical literature (criteria and sources) explaining why this is relevant; a list of keywords and databases used to search or identify the relevant literature; a draft bibliography (note that the proposal text must be referenced like a term paper). The Report should be between 12,000   15,000 words (all front and end matter included), double-spaced, typed and appropriately referenced.  The Report should contain the following: (1)  Title page -- your name, the date, the organization you worked for, the period of the internship, your External Supervisor s name and the word count. (2)  Description of the Internship   This relatively brief section should include some background to the organization, the department and the projects on which you worked. (3)  Body of the Report   This must represent the substantive part of the Report (at least 10,000 words) and should link some aspect (or several aspects) of a project on which you worked with some aspect (or several aspects) of what you learned in courses of your Master. This should be composed of: Introduction: What precisely is the purpose of the Internship Report; why is the topic relevant; how is the analysis or critical reflection organized.   Theory:  A comprehensive review of the relevant theoretical literature and why you chose this set of literature in relation to your topic.    Case Study: The case study could be directly related to your internship experience or could have been inspired during this experience, examples: Case:  the internship is the case to be studied. Policy issue: A critical perspective/reflection of a policy issue. Investigation: A detailed description and analysis of an investigation conducted by the student as part of their internship. Conclusion:  Brief review of the Report s argument(s) and findings, and presentation of the theoretical, practical and/or political implications of the Report s findings.     *For more information on the Structure of the Internship Report refer to the Guidelines for Internship Requirements.   (4) Full Bibliography   In alphabetical order of the author s last name. Follow MLA, Chicago, Turabian, or some other standard style manual. All entries must have been referenced in the paper. The usual range is between 20 and 50 sources (other than websites). Websites need to be cited appropriately as well (author, title, access date, etc.).

As the Sustainability Analyst at Concordia University, I am responsible for the planning, coordination, and execution of research that assess the sustainability situation of the University. Since sustainability is a multi-faceted concept including environmental, social, and economic sciences, the Master in Environmental Assessment program helped me developed new skills complementing my engineering background. Through the program I had the opportunity to work with colleagues from very different educational programs, which is a critical skill to develop in order to tackle the complexities of today s challenges. My internship at the Stockholm Environment Institute in Sweden gave me the opportunity to connect with internationally-renowned researchers and professionals related to the field of sustainability and to directly collaborate with government officials. This priceless opportunity adds solid credentials to someone s professional profile. Compared to large impersonal classrooms, the smaller workgroups of the MEnv program parallel a professional team-based working environment and incite people to share knowledge in a mutually motivating learning environment. Dominique Croteau, Sustainability Analyst, M.Env 2012 I am currently a doctoral student employed as a Research Fellow at the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin, Germany, working with the Assessments and Scientific Policy Advice working group. My PhD work focuses on various aspects related to the engagement of stakeholders in global environmental assessments such as UNEP s Global Environment Outlook series, the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and others. The approaches and methods I learned during my Master s degree in Environmental Impact Assessment at Concordia University, such as qualitative and quantitative statistical analysis, environmental economics, and geographic information systems techniques, have proven invaluable in my PhD work. In addition, my internship with the Biodiversity and Human Health Cross-Cutting Initiative at the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity gave me the expertise and the motivation necessary to succeed in my application for a PhD program working on assessment-making at the global scale. While for many, the Environmental Impact Assessment program provides an excellent stepping stone into a professional position, it may also open doors for advancing your education even further and help to expand your network and knowledge base to the global scale. Jennifer Garard, Research Fellow & PhD candidate, M.Env 2013 Concordia s Master in Environment (Environmental Impact Assessment) (M.Env) helped me to get to where I am today. I am currently a full time permanent employee at the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) as an Aboriginal consultation advisor and I am also the Administrator for the CNSC s Participant Funding Program. The knowledge base and experience that the M.Env program provided me has been invaluable to my day-to-day work. The course work was engaging, challenging and practical. The M.Env provided me with a strong basis and understanding of federal environmental laws, regulatory policy and report writing. I also learned how to manage large, complex projects and effectively analyze environmental assessment and other technical reports. The courses offered in conjunction with the M.Env were varied and provided me with a holistic education which helped effectively prepare me for a career in a dynamic federal government regulatory agency. The internship component of the M.Env was very useful in helping me jump start my career. The M.Env internship coordinator assisted me in finding a suitable internship and provided a lot of support during and after my internship. Although my internship was with a different federal department, the experience, skills and connections made through my internship experience contributed directly to me finding a permanent job with the Government of Canada. I truly enjoy my work and I would recommend the M.Env at Concordia to anyone who has an interest in an environmental assessment or environmental policy related field. Adam Levine, consultation advisor, M.Env 2013 I have been working at Terragon Environmental Technologies Inc. since the beginning of my internship in May 2013. Terragon s mission is to develop and commercialize technologies and products that offer communities and enterprises a practical and economical option for the safe generation of energy and water from their waste.  Since my internship I have become a permanent full-time employee focusing on the analysis and application of legislative and regulatory requirements against project scopes, the submission of regulatory permit and license applications as well as the coordination and support of document preparation including environmental assessments, studies and approval applications. Concordia s Master in Environment (Environmental Impact Assessment) has prepared me for working in a team environment and coordinating information from several different bodies/institutions. The program provided a solid foundation, upon which I base all of my work and research. Karolina Apland, Terragon Environmental Technologies, M.Env 2014 Cristina Romanelli, Intern We are deeply appreciative for all the intern has done for our team, at a time when we were especially under pressure to produce results.

Students who are ineligible to enter the internship, but have successfully completed all course work, may transfer to the Diploma in Environmental Assessment. Objectives The objective of the internship is to provide students with an opportunity to gain practical, hands-on experience under professional supervision in a field related to environmental assessment. Procedures and Conditions When The internship is completed at the end of the residency requirement (minimum two terms). Under exceptional circumstances, it may be completed earlier, but only with the approval of the EA Graduate Program Director. The internship may be undertaken at any time in a calendar year, and can span academic years (e.g. August-October, July-November). The duration of the internship should be a minimum of 4 months. Where Internships may be held at any of the following: Government of Canada agencies (e.g. Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, Environment Canada) Provincial agencies (e.g. Ontario Ministry of the Environment) Consulting or engineering firms (e.g. Stantec) Non-governmental agencies (e.g. Convention on Biological Diversity) There is no restriction on location. This may be paid or volunteer work. Remuneration for the work done is negotiated between the intern and employer. For the purposes of the course remuneration is not required. Who Students registered in the internship must have full-time status and be in good standing. For every intern, there must be a person at the place of the internship who is willing to supervise them. This person is known as the 'Work Supervisor.' What The work undertaken by the intern may be part of an ongoing project, where the intern works as part of a team, and is responsible for a portion of a report or an individual research project on a specific research topic. This work will contribute to a 12,000-15,000 word report written by the intern following the completion of the job placement, and an oral presentation will be scheduled in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment. In all cases, the internship must be directly relevant to environmental assessment and/or the environmental field. For more information on the internship report and timeline go to the  guidelines for internship requirements . How All students should register their readiness for an internhsip with the Internship Coordinator at the beginning of the term before they hope to go on an internship (i.e. in January for internships starting in the summer; May for internships in the fall and September for internship in the winter). Students must find their own internship, or apply to internships available through the Internship Coordinator. In either case, the student must keep the Internship Coordinator apprised of their status and progress. When the Internship Coordinator has an available internship, the procedure is as follows: Students will be emailed by the Internship Coordinator; Interested students should apply by the deadline on the posting; The student will be chosen on the merits of his/her qualifications, first by the employer. When the student has found an internship, the procedures are as follows: The student discusses the internship position with the Internship Coordinator to ensure that it is acceptable. A proposed placement outline will be submitted to the Internship Coordinator. This should contain specific information, including: (A template is provided to the student) Name and location of the company/government agency/NGO sponsoring the internship; A letter from the Work Supervisor (including contact information) agreeing to supervise the student for the work; Anticipated duration of the internship; A detailed job description, explaining what work is to be done in the course of the internship, why it is appropriate as an internship in EA, and the anticipated learning and professional development that the intern expects to gain as a result of the completion of the work. There must be mutual understanding and written agreement amongst all involved (student, EA Director, Internship Coordinator, Work Supervisor) of the work to be done, prior to commencement of the internship. This will normally be in the form of an agreement signed by all of the parties. NOTE: Although the department will actively seek internship placements from which the intern may apply for, the department does not guarantee placements. It is the responsibility of the student to seek and secure a relevant internship placement. Completion of ENVS 696 A pass/fail grade will be submitted on behalf of the student by the Graduate Program Assistant when: The work placement has been completed. The intern has submitted a Final Report on his/her internship. The intern has presented his/her Internship Final Report at the oral defense. The Work Supervisor has submitted an evaluation of the intern indicating that the student has successfully completed the internship, per the written agreement. Note: It is recognized that there can be some fluidity as the internship evolves. If the internship project(s) vary significantly from the original proposal, the EA Director and the Internship Coordinator must be informed immediately, in writing, by the student. It is expected that the Work Supervisor will also be aware, or will be made aware by the intern, of any change. A decision will then be made as to the applicability of the new work to the success of the internship.

While much has been made of the  bromance  between Trudeau and Obama, and the possibilities that their relationship presents for cross-border cooperation, little of what was announced on border security was new. Rather, the initiatives simply reiterate initiatives set out in the Beyond the Border agreement of 2011. This is not to suggest, however, that sweeping changes at the border are not underway. Indeed, since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the Canada-US border has been reshaped by wide-ranging bilateral and trilateral agreements, as well as ad hoc and incremental legislative changes. The border has become increasingly securitized, even militarized, while border functions have also been pushed away from the border. In this paper I examine the impact and implications of the hardened border, with particular attention to the politics of mobility.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract This thesis is an interdisciplinary study of the norms and forms of everyday life in the historic quarter of Karachi, Pakistan, as they relate to the sovereign imaginaries that animate the way urban subjects inhabit the space of the city. It examines the evolution of the urban form of the city and shows how historical constructions of space, empire and nation structured present formulations of political subjectivity at the micro and macro levels. Using three disciplinary lenses history, anthropology and political science the study captures the diverse forces and sovereignties that have shaped ideas of life and the organization of space in a complex urban environment. Based on previously unexamined archival material and ethnographic field research in the historic inner city area of Karachi, it traces the effects of historic formations of the space of the city on the lived space of the streets and neighbourhoods. It locates the politics of space that unfolds in the streets and neighbourhoods of the city in significant shifts in its colonial and postcolonial history. In doing so it brings attention to the limits of biopolitical subject formation, where the processes of making social and political worlds in common exceed the state s attempt at discipline and subjugation. The social and political formations that were the object of this study, consist of different kinds of sovereign arrangements that attempt to rule and govern space in parallel to, and often overlapping with, state governance. These sovereign arrangements range from custom and kinship-based organizations to political and religious groups and movements that seek to establish norms around the social and spatial management of the neighbourhood. The finding of this study is that multiple sovereign assemblages act to both challenge and reproduce state sovereignty. These sovereignties operate in different domains   political, religious and clan-based social networks that constantly overlap and engage with the state to claim legitimacy and a share of urban resources. The most significant finding of this study is that sovereign imaginaries drawn upon by these arrangements go beyond the nation to draw upon histories and trajectories that are transregional and transcendental, bringing into question the nation-state s sole claim to territorial sovereignty.

When it comes to global warming, there are seven big contributors: the United States, China, Russia, Brazil, India, Germany and the United Kingdom. A new study published in Environmental Research Letters reveals that these countries were collectively responsible for more than 60 per cent of pre-2005 global warming. Uniquely, it also assigns a temperature-change value to each country that reflects its contribution to observed global warming. The study was conducted at Concordia under the leadership of Damon Matthews, an associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment. In a straight ranking, the U.S. is an unambiguous leader, responsible for a global temperature increase of 0.15 C. That s close to 20 per cent of the observed warming. China and Russia account for around eight per cent each; Brazil and India seven per cent; and Germany and the U.K. around five per cent each. Canada comes in tenth place, right after France and Indonesia. Although it may seem surprising that less industrialized countries, including Brazil and Indonesia, ranked so highly, their positions reflect carbon dioxide emissions related to deforestation. In the study, the research team used a new methodology to calculate national contributions to global warming. It weighted each type of emission according to the atmospheric lifetime of the temperature change it caused. Using data from 1750 onward, the team accounted for carbon dioxide contributions from fossil fuel burning and land-use change, along with methane, nitrous oxide and sulphate aerosol emissions. Matthews and his colleagues also experimented with scaling the emissions to the size of the corresponding area (see graphic above). Western Europe, the U.S., Japan and India are hugely expanded, reflecting emissions much greater than would be expected based on their geographic area. Russia, China and Brazil stay the same. Taken in this light, the climate contributions of Brazil and China don t seem so out of line   they are perfectly proportionate to the countries  land masses. Canada and Australia become stick thin as their land mass is much larger than their share of the global-warming pie. Meanwhile, dividing each country s climate contribution by its population paints a different picture. Amongst the 20 largest total emitters, the top seven per capita positions are occupied by developed countries, with Canada falling in third place behind the U.K. and the U.S. In this ranking, China and India drop to the bottom of the list. Matthews s study highlights how much individual countries have contributed to the climate problem, as well as the huge disparity between rich and poor with respect to per-person contributions to global warming. Acknowledging these disparities, and then moving to correct them, may be a fundamental requirement for success in efforts to decrease global greenhouse-gas emissions. * Parts of this text appear courtesy of New Scientist magazine.

Freak snowstorms. Devastating tsunamis. Polar vortexes. The Earth s climate is undeniably becoming increasingly volatile. A number of professors and students from Concordia s four academic faculties are examining the effects of climate change and looking for ways to sustain human activities without depleting the Earth s resources. Their research and teaching are serving as scientific warnings, opening up exciting new opportunities revolving around sustainability and deepening human understanding and awareness. We present a few of their efforts. Skating on thin ice Damon Matthews is an associate professor in Concordia s department of geography, planning and environment. He says it s not too late to stop the rise of the earth s temperature   and the decline of outdoor ice hockey   but it would require  prompt and significant action.  When Damon Matthews co-published a 2012 paper warning that the days of Canada s outdoor skating rinks could be numbered, the associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment received more media atten tion than he ever had before. Hockey in Canada is, after all, sacred.  Based on the conditions needed to create outdoor rinks and what we ve observed from the meteorological data over the previous 30 years, we extrapolated that we have about three more decades of viable outdoor skating,  Matthews says.  That really touched a cultural nerve among Canadians that I hope will help lead to significant action in terms of reducing carbon emissions.  Matthews uses mathematical calcula tions to model climate response to carbon dioxide (CO2) and other emissions.  The ratio is a 1.5-degree-Celsius-higher global temperature for every trillion tonnes of carbon emitted into our atmosphere,  he explains.  And while it took us 200 years to emit a half-trillion tonnes, it will take us only 50 years to emit another half-tril lion at current levels.  With carbon emissions still increasing, that additional 500 billion tonnes might occur even sooner, he adds. The only way to stop the planet from warming further is to stop emissions im mediately.  Of course, zero emissions are unlikely to happen overnight because people won t decommission current production and transportation systems or change their habits that quickly,  Matthews says. Matthews and his Concordia colleagues have therefore looked at the amount of emissions already embedded into the cur rent fossil fuel infrastructure to determine the amount of  wiggle room  to stabilize the increase in the Earth s overall temper ature to only 2 degrees Celsius.  If we want global warming to stay below 2 degrees Celsius, we need to cut all emissions by at least half,  he says. Given this reality, some researchers are proposing to remove CO2 from the atmosphere to keep global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.  That s when people start talking about geo-engineering projects, such as artificial trees to suck CO2 from the atmosphere,  Matthews says. He s conducting simulations to de termine how the climate might respond to some of the proposed technological solutions.  For instance, one idea is to spray reflective particles into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight,  Matthews says.  However, that would introduce a whole other suite of potential side effects on the climate system, such as impacts on the ozone layer and changes in rainfall patterns.  His modelling indicates that reaching zero emissions as soon as possible through renewable energy sources and significant changes in our lifestyle and habitat remains the best solution. To show what needs to be done, one of his recent projects involved calculating the historical emissions produced by nations and how each country s emissions are contributing to the global tempera ture increase.  Of course, the United States produces the most emissions, and Canada ranked 10th, which is not very good given its relatively small popula tion,  he says.  We re hoping this kind of information will spur governments to action.  There s a misconception that even if we stopped emitting carbon, the Earth s temperature would continue to rise, and that s not the case,  he emphasizes.  We could stabilize the planet s temperature if we take prompt and significant ac tion.  It s why Matthews conducts studies that alert people to the fact that if carbon emissions aren t dramatically curbed without delay, other young boys and girls might not have the chance to learn hockey on an outdoor rink like Wayne Gretzky did. If carbon emissions aren t dramatically curbed without delay, other young boys and girls might not have the chance to learn hockey on an outdoor rink like Wayne Gretzky did, Raising awareness through art Ricardo Dal Farra, an associate professor in the Department of Music, has worked on several balance-unbalance conferences. balance-unbalance merges art and issues of sustainability. Research in the fine arts has a less obvious connection to sustainability than that of other disciplines   but Ricardo Dal Farra, an associate professor in the Department of Music, is helping change that perception. Dal Farra has been a leading organizer of three international BALANCE-UNBALANCE conferences that have brought artists together with scientists, engineers, sociologists, policymakers and others to help resolve the world s pressing environmental issues. BALANCE-UNBALANCE 2011 involved the collaboration of colleagues from Concordia s departments of Geography, Planning and Environment, Political Science, Design and Computation Arts, Communication Studies and Music, as well as the David O Brien Centre for Sustainable Enterprise. The highly successful 2013 BALANCE-UNBALANCE conference was held at the UNESCO-designated Noosa Biosphere in Queensland, Australia. It prompted the Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre to approach Dal Farra about creating some original music to play during their presentations and workshops, as well as games that the organization uses to help government officials and other key people to understand the complexities of disaster risk management. Dal Farra suggested a contest to find original music and sound-art works for the climate centre s overall humanitarian responses to people dealing with floods, drought and other disasters related to climate change.  Pablo Suarez, the centre s associate director for Research and Innovation, was so pleased that he asked if we could also launch a contest for music miniatures specifically for the efforts to obtain mosquito nets to prevent dengue fever,  Dal Farra says. The contests have been a springboard for the  art!   climate  project, which aims to use art as a catalyst for social awareness and change.  To compose a piece about climate change or dengue fever, you really have to understand what the problem is, so the contest rules prompted entrants to read white papers and other documents about climate change and its consequences,  Dal Farra says.  The contests encouraged sound artists to reflect significantly on the situation and what kind of message they wanted to get across.  A jury of highly regarded composers and media artists chose 39 submissions as being of very good quality from among the large number received. The climate centre selected nine compositions for its purposes. Dal Farra and the other contest organizers are programming many of the remaining high-quality pieces into conferences and festivals related to climate change around the world.  We re also in the process of putting all the pieces on a website  with a Creative Commons licence that gives organizations and individuals the permission to download and use them in connection with any initiatives specifically related to dealing with climate change,  he says. The response and outcome of the initial contests were so successful that the  art!   climate  project and BALANCE-UNBALANCE conference series were featured in the April 2013 issue of Leonardo   Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology.  We really have shown how art can play a fundamental role in social change,  Dal Farra says.  It s a message that I keep emphasizing to my students by integrating issues related to climate change in my teaching and making them a part of the curriculum activities for my composition of electroacoustic music classes.   We really have shown how art can play a fundamental role in social change,  Dal Farra says. Creating new value from old goods Department of Marketing associate professor Zeynep Arsel s research includes looking at  upcycling,  the process of taking someone else s trash and turning it into something of value. A lamp from the 1980s may be nothing but junk to a lot of us. Yet some people would love to get their hands on one. It s this kind of unprecedented value for items that Zeynep Arsel, an associate professor in the Department of Marketing at the John Molson School of Business (JMSB), is researching as a consumption scholar. She s looking at how people s evolving ideas of what holds value might help to save the planet s resources.  I am increasingly seeing people desire items in ways that were unimaginable in the past,  Arsel says.  And I m examining how that desire could help to avoid resource depletion in the long run.  Arsel s research is focused on how people are creating value by trading items that wouldn t otherwise be marketable.  This includes exchanging unsellable items, such as used makeup,  she notes. Her current project involves examining various forms of exchange within Canada and the United States that exist outside the formal marketplace, such as bartering.  I m investigating how people are creating and maintaining systems that I would say make up for the limitations of the formal marketplace,  she explains. She is also looking at upcycling   the process of using what would otherwise become trash to create new items, such as leather bags from worn jackets.  People are really starting to recognize the dormant value of the items in their closets and cupboards and putting that into action,  she says.  I m researching this in terms of the concept of value which I think needs to be re-theorized in light of these relatively new activities.  The growing popularity of the Freecycle Network , which claims nearly eight million participants around the world, provides another example. The site helps individuals to pass along and receive items for free.  People are using the site to give things away because they realize the value in creating more space for themselves, or they want to increase their moral capital by helping others in the process of facilitating the reuse of items rather than just discarding them,  Arsel says.  I think there may be a real con sciousness-awakening here.  Arsel is noticing that as some are becoming more aware of the dormant value in used and upcycled items, they are creating formal marketplaces for them. Entrepreneurs are establishing upcycling businesses. Organizations are opening thrift shops to raise money for medical research or charitable efforts. For now, Arsel is focusing on value that isn t determined by a monetary amount.  I m more interested in floating value,  she says.  What is it that makes  people decide that a used object is worth something? What is it that makes some of us seek out items that others consider junk or garbage? What determines a fair exchange? How is it that a book could end up being a fair trade for a chair?  Arsel has received a wide array of answers so far, which is making it a real challenge to establish some kind of shared criteria.  It s very subjective,  she emphasizes.  What s interesting is that people are not just exchanging physical items in many cases, but objects that come with stories that form part of their value structure.  As more networks for bartering or swapping become established, Arsel suspects that society s mainstream notions of value might also keep shifting. She speculates:  Fixed currencies might become less important in determining exchanges.  Arsel s research is focused on how people are creating value by trading items that wouldn t otherwise be marketable.  This includes exchanging unsellable items, such as used makeup,  she notes.

Concordia research shows which countries are most responsible for the cost of environmental damage from global warming Posted on September 8, 2015 | By: Cl a Desjardins All countries have contributed to recent climate change, but some much more so than others. Those that have contributed more than their fair share have accumulated a climate debt, owed to countries that have contributed less to historical warming. This is the implication of a new study published in Nature Climate Change, in which Concordia University researcher Damon Matthews shows how national carbon and climate debts could be used to decide who should pay for the global costs of climate mitigation and damages. The countries that have accumulated the largest carbon debts on account of higher than average per-capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. The U.S. alone carries 40 per cent of the cumulative world debt, while Canada carries about four per cent. On the other side, the carbon creditors   those whose share of CO2 emissions has been smaller than their share of world population   are India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, Brazil and China, with India holding 30 per cent of the total world credit.   Thinking of climate change in terms of debts and credits for individual countries shows how much countries have over- or under-contributed to historical warming, relative to their proportion of the world s population over time,  explains Matthews, study author and associate professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment.  This paints a striking picture of the historical inequalities among countries with respect to their greenhouse gas emissions and consequent responsibility for climate changes.  Calculating climate responsibility To estimate differences in national responsibility for historical climate changes, Matthews first calculated carbon debts and credits based on fossil fuel CO2 emission and population records since 1990. It was around this date that scientific knowledge and public understanding of the dangers of human-driven climate changes began to solidify. Since that time, the total carbon debt across all debtor nations has increased to 250 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. And it s still going up: the increase in world carbon debt in 2013 alone was 13 billion tonnes, or about 35 per cent of global CO2 emissions in that year. So what is the monetary value of this debt?  According to a recent U.S. government report, the current best estimate of the social cost of present-day CO2 emissions is about $40 USD per tonne of CO2,  says Matthews.  Multiply $40 by the 13 billion tonnes of carbon debt accrued in 2013, and you get $520 billion. This cost estimate gives us an indication of how much we could be paying to help lower-emitting countries cope with the costs of climate changes, or develop their economies along carbon-free pathways.  Looking at the total world carbon debt, the numbers are even more staggering: the 250 billion tonnes of debt accumulated since 1990, at $40 per tonne, represents $10 trillion USD.  No matter how you look at this picture, these numbers are really big   much, much larger than even the most generous financial commitments currently pledged by countries to help with the cost of climate adaptation and damages in vulnerable countries.  CO2 emissions vs. degrees of debt Matthews also calculated how much each country has over- or under-contributed to temperature increases as a result of a range of different greenhouse gas emissions. By this measure, the total accumulated world climate debt comes to 0.1 C since 1990, close to a third of observed warming over this period of time. Again the U.S. is the single largest debtor, and India is the largest creditor. Some countries, however, like Brazil and Indonesia, switch from being carbon creditors, to being among the climate debtor countries, as a result of the additional greenhouse gas emissions produced by deforestation and agriculture.  This idea of climate and carbon debts and credits highlight the large historical inequalities with respect to how much individual countries have contributed to climate warming,  says Matthews.  The historical debts and credits calculated here could be a helpful tool to inform policy discussions relating to historical responsibility and burden sharing, by providing a measure of who should pay  and how much they might be expected to pay   for the costs of mitigation and climate damages in countries with lower emissions.  What does this mean for the upcoming Paris meetings? As countries continue to announce their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (or INDCs) leading up to December s climate talks in Paris, it is becoming increasingly clear that these emissions pledges will not be enough to meet the international goal of limiting global warming to 2 C (see related research by Matthews  research group published last month in Environmental Research Letters ). The idea of additionally accounting for debts and credits would of course increase the burden placed on countries with high historical emissions.  But these historical inequalities are real and substantial, and need to be fully acknowledged,  says Matthews.  My hope is that this discussion will help lead to a stronger and more meaningful global climate agreement.    Find out more about research in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment .

As vice president of the Freshwater program at World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF-Canada), Snider is overseeing the first centralized database of Canadian freshwater and its biggest threats. WWF-Canada recently rolled out the benchmarking project Watershed Reports: Taking the Pulse of Canada s Rivers. The interactive website provides a timely assessment of Canada s 25 major watersheds   the interconnected rivers, wetlands and lakes that drain into a common body of water. The World Wildlife Fund's Watershed Reports is an online tool that reports the health of Canada's water systems. | Courtesy: World Wildlife Fund The user-friendly tool aims to convey information clearly, for all to understand. It appeals to scientists, recreational outdoor enthusiasts and even schoolchildren. It shows completed assessments for half of Canada s watersheds and WWF-Canada estimates it will complete the remainder by 2017. Watershed Reports assesses the health of a water system based on water flow, water quality, bugs and fish. Seven criteria are used to rank threats: pollution, climate change, overuse of water, alteration of flows, invasive species and habitat loss and fragmentation. Concordia experience paved the way Snider says his graduate diploma in environmental assessment helped prepare him for his role as the project s leader. James Snider, GrDip 07, leads the WWF-Canada Watershed Reports project.  At Concordia I was lucky to get a nature conservation internship, because that served as my bridge into the not-for-profit environmental sector,  he says.  I learned hard skills and soft skills that landed me a job with WWF six months after graduating.  A teacher s assistant while at Concordia, Snider started out at WWF-Canada as a data-crunching geographic information system analyst. Now he supervises a Canada-wide team of specialists from WWF-Canada headquarters in Toronto. Although he considers himself more of a technician than a science communicator, he engages with different types of organizations, from conservation groups to government monitoring programs.  I m involved in projects at various levels across the country,  Snider says.  They pave the way for community programs and data collection to take place.  Canadians taking responsibility for water systems Recently the conservation sector has been focusing on empowering individuals and groups to help with large-scale projects such as Watershed Reports.  We re formatting a network approach,  Snider explains. He points to the importance of cross-organizational collaboration.  Citizen scientists, community groups, recreational campers and manufacturing plants all have a role to play in nature conservation.  The report s strong foundation of data will make it easier for advocacy organizations to inform high-level decision makers in policy and best-business practices. The goal is to have all of Canada s watersheds rated as  good condition  by 2025   although most of the watersheds assessed so far show concerning threat levels. Watershed Reports challenges Canadians to act. Its interactive map also displays volunteering and clean-up opportunities.  We want to see a broad audience log on to Watershed Reports, from a family of recreational campers to a construction company CEO,  Snider says.  Ultimately, we hope to provide better local water management from a national online platform.  #CUalumni ","title":"Fresh information on Canadian freshwater"},{"url":"https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/geography-planning-environment/news/cunews/main/stories/2015/11/24/graduate-student-research-aims-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-assign-responsibility.html","body":"A Concordia grad student s carbon-leak solution Daniel Horen Greenford s research aims to assign responsibility and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions Posted on November 25, 2015 | By: Christian Durand  By including emissions embodied in traded goods into national inventories, a better case can be made for bringing more countries to the negotiating table.\" | Photo by Kim Seng (Flickr CC) Next week, the world converges on Paris for the United Nations Conference on Climate Change .

Matthews  runs the  Concordia Climate Science, Impacts and Mitigation Studies (C2SIMS) Lab , which aims to improve our understanding of the science of climate change, its impacts on human and environmental systems, and address how best to mitigate human disruption of the climate.  Daniel Horen Greenford One example of the kind of research underway in the lab is Daniel Horen Greenford s ongoing Master s thesis project, in which he s attempting to calculate national contributions to climate change using his own formalizations of emissions accounting. If real change is to occur, says Horen Greenford, leaders and experts need to learn from the mistakes of past global initiatives. Horen Greenford uses the example of the Kyoto Protocol as a climate policy that hurt more than it helped. It allowed manufacturing to be displaced to non-signatory countries whose factories pollute more per unit than those in the developed nations where production originated. The phenomenon is known as  carbon leakage,  and it has caused a net increase in global emissions. At the same time, developed nations are able to congratulate themselves on meeting their reduction targets.   This standard has allowed wealthy nations to dislocate their emissions in order to meet their reduction targets while global emissions still rise,  Horen explains.  It s like a high school bully forcing another kid to hide contraband when the teacher checks his bag.  A different way of tracking emissions To tackle this issue, Horen Greenford is developing a new accounting method that effectively captures the effects of trade and allocates emissions embodied in goods to trading partners in a fair way. The model weighs emissions according to their economic benefit, using a definition of utility rooted in ethical considerations of necessity, while respecting geographical circumstances and cultural plurality. The production of goods is weighted in accordance with their utility. Essential items have the highest levels of utility while luxury items have the lowest. Weighting penalizes nations less for consuming goods that are more useful and holds populations more responsible for items they consume that are not necessary for survival. For example, a region that has a lot of cars should assume responsibility for the emissions used in the production of their vehicles in other countries, especially when producing regions do not have high car-ownership rates.  We must provide an account of emissions that better captures responsibility for emissions and can be used to hold nations accountable accordingly in international policy agreements,  says Horen Greenford.  This boils down to how we tabulate national inventories. By including emissions embodied in traded goods into national inventories, a better case can be made for bringing more countries to the negotiating table   one that is more robust and has greater considerations of equity.  Facing climate change in our city This model could also be used at the municipal level, too, says Horen Greenford. An urban inventory of all goods and services imported and exported could be traced across the supply chain to give cities a sense of their global impact on greenhouse gas emissions.  Here in Montreal, figuring out how we are impacting climate change would help policy and inform businesses and governments to make better choices when it comes to urban planning and infrastructure investment.

This op-ed was  recently published in the Montreal Gazette . With the adoption of the Paris Agreement , the world has finally struck a deal to fight climate change. The goal  to hold temperatures to  well below 2  C  and pursue  efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5  C   is impressively ambitious. If we can achieve this, we stand a good chance of avoiding some truly dangerous climate impacts. On the other hand, the Paris Agreement does not include mechanisms to compel countries to act, and countries  current emissions commitments will not be enough to achieve the agreement s temperature goal. The success or failure of the Paris Agreement will therefore depend entirely on the collective actions of all nations in the years to come. And achieving the 2 C target let alone 1.5 C  will require strong action on every front. The Paris Agreement states that countries should seek to  reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible   and to undertake rapid reductions   so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century.  This is unfortunately not the clearest of statements. So here is what it actually means: To stabilize global temperatures at any level, we need to stop adding carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Net emissions from human activity must eventually reach zero, such that any continued emissions are balanced by an equivalent amount of intentional removal from the atmosphere. To meet the 2 C goal, this net-zero target must be reached by the year 2070. To stay below 1.5 C, we have to hit net-zero by closer to 2050. Meeting the 2 C target will be hard. Staying below 1.5 C will be even harder. Impossible? Only if we don t try hard enough. Encouragingly, there is now some evidence of progress. According to new emissions data from the Global Carbon Project published last week in Nature Climate Change, global CO2 emissions have been stable since 2013. Emissions from 2013-2014 increased by only 0.6 per cent (compared to 2.5 per cent increases in previous years), and emissions in 2015 may have actually decreased back to 2013 levels. This is the result of decreased coal use in China coupled with rapid global growth of non-fossil energy sources, and marks the first time that emissions have not increased during a time of global economic expansion. It may be that a  global peaking  of CO2 emissions has occurred sooner than we dared to imagine possible. And if nations take up the challenge of the Paris Agreement, this might even be enough to move us further along a decreasing emissions trajectory. Canada has an opportunity to step up and lead this global effort. According to researchers at Stanford University, Canada could transition to 100 per cent renewable energy sources by 2050, using a combination of wind, solar and hydro power. This is the bar we have to set for ourselves. We have both the responsibility and the ability to act to cut our emissions more quickly than the rest of the world. It is therefore essential that the target of eventual net-zero emissions be internalized at every level of decision-making. New energy infrastructure needs to be carbon-free, and existing fossil fuel energy infrastructure needs to be either decommissioned or retrofitted with carbon capture technology. New buildings should be built to be powered by renewable energy technology, and existing buildings retrofitted with new energy technologies. New vehicles should be built without internal combustion engines, and existing gasoline-powered vehicles phased out. None of this is impossible. It is just a question of making the right choices. We need to realize and acknowledge that every greenhouse gas emission that we produce takes us incrementally closer to the level of climate change we need to avoid. We need to spend our remaining carbon budget with the utmost reticence and care. The Paris Agreement tells us where we need to go, but it will be up to us to choose the path that will take us there.

But what does that mean locally? A new study published in Nature Climate Change pinpoints the temperature increases caused by CO 2 emissions in different regions around the world. Using simulation results from 12 global climate models, Damon Matthews , a professor in Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment , along with post-doctoral researcher Martin Leduc, produced a map that shows how the climate changes in response to cumulative carbon emissions around the world. They found that temperature increases in most parts of the world respond linearly to cumulative emissions.  This provides a simple and powerful link between total global emissions of carbon dioxide and local climate warming,  says Matthews.  This approach can be used to show how much human emissions are to blame for local changes.  Leduc and Matthews, along with co-author Ramo n de Eli a from Ouranos , a Montreal-based consortium on regional climatology, analyzed the results of simulations in which CO2 emissions caused the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to increase by 1 per cent each year until it reached four times the levels recorded prior to the Industrial Revolution. Globally, the researchers saw an average temperature increase of 1.7  0.4 C per trillion tonnes of carbon in CO2 emissions (TtC), which is consistent with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . But the scientists went beyond these globally averaged temperature rises, to calculate climate change at a local scale. At a glance, here are the average increases per trillion tonnes of carbon that we emit, separated geographically ( view the full table here ): Western North America 2.4   0.6 C Central North America 2.3   0.4 C Eastern North America 2.4   0.5 C Alaska 3.6   1.4 C Greenland and Northern Canada 3.1   0.9 C North Asia 3.1   0.9 C Southeast Asia 1.5   0.3 C Central America 1.8   0.4 C Eastern Africa 1.9   0.4 C  As these numbers show, equatorial regions warm the slowest, while the Arctic warms the fastest. Of course, this is what we ve already seen happen   rapid changes in the Arctic are outpacing the rest of the planet,  says Matthews. There are also marked differences between land and ocean, with the temperature increase for the oceans averaging 1.4   0.3 C TtC, compared to 2.2   0.5 C for land areas.  To date, humans have emitted almost 600 billion tonnes of carbon,  says Matthews.  This means that land areas on average have already warmed by 1.3 C because of these emissions. At current emission rates, we will have emitted enough CO 2 to warm land areas by 2 C within 3 decades.

Whether you re waiting for a bus that seems like it will never show up, or experiencing a sudden power outage on the subway, you are not alone: public transit woes are common around the world.   New research from Concordia uses mobile technology to map routes, calculate travel times and help alleviate some of the most pesky transport issues. Getting around in the developing world While transportation troubles might seem particularly painful in Western urban centres, they can be even more keenly felt in the developing world. That s why one of Zachary Patterson  s former students   now with the Agence fran aise de d veloppement  contacted him to map the public transit system in Ghana s capital, Accra. Patterson, an associate professor in the Department Geography, Planning and Environment , hopes the results of his project will help Western municipalities see how they can learn from these experiences in Africa.  Cities in the developing world face a common challenge when trying to better organize their transportation systems: they don t have accurate information about the transportation network that already exists,  says Patterson, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Transportation and Land Use Linkages for Regional Sustainability.  Because data collection is a complicated and costly exercise, city officials don t have the resources to thoroughly review their network,  he says.  That s why using inexpensive, readily available mobile technology is such a valuable tool.  The trouble with trotros At the heart of Accra s transit system is a fleet of small public transit buses known as trotros. The Accra Municipal Assembly has been working with AFD for a number of years to better regulate the trotro system. Initial regulatory steps identified and licensed routes, but the number of routes in operation and their actual itineraries, remained unknown. That s where Patterson, a former transportation planner with Agence m tropolitaine de transport in Montreal , came in. Accra s Department of Transport (DoT) and the Agence fran aise de d veloppement undertook a survey of the city s trotro routes armed with GPS-enabled smart phones to map the city s transit network with a very limited budget, and a short time frame. Using two mobile apps, DataMobile , which Patterson had initially developed at Concordia to map transportation habits in Montreal, and Tap Log , surveyors rode the trotros while recording GPS points and logging stops along the routes. The recorded data was then processed and analyzed by Patterson s research team back in Montreal. Ghost routes The results were surprising for both Patterson and Accra s city planners. They found that the transit network was full of  ghost routes    pathways that had been claimed by drivers but that weren t in use.  Drivers would preventatively register routes that they thought would one day be profitable in order to have a monopoly on them,  Patterson says.  Registering a route gives a driver the exclusive right to operate it, so that they can make sure that no competing driver can scoop them in the future.  These ghost routes were an important discovery for the DoT, as it provided a clearer sense of the actual extent of trotro services   315 active routes instead of the originally claimed 580. What s best for the West? The AccraMobile project was recently presented at the 95th annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board in the United States.  This study shows how international collaborations can play a role in helping developing countries to take advantage of leapfrogging technologies to plan their own transportation systems,  he says.

This spring you can acquire basic skills, get support for a project and learn how GIS could be relevant to your profession. From May 30 to June 3, Concordia s  Department of Geography, Planning and Environment  is offering a  new summer certificate course  for people seeking to enhance their GIS credentials.  GIS is a growing domain with more and more professional opportunities that range from data collection to map-making to software development,  says Angela Kross. | Photo by David Ward GIS collect, store, manipulate and analyze all sorts of spatial and geographical data.  This program is special because it provides a great alternative for participants to achieve basic or advanced GIS skills specifically tailored to their project needs, outside of a conventional academic-credit program,  says lecturer  Angela Kross , a geospatial technologies specialist who was hired in August 2015 to direct and teach the certificate.  We use geospatial tools such as GPS and Google Maps in our daily activities,  Kross says.  GIS is also a growing domain with more and more professional opportunities that range from data collection to map-making to software development.  The program is designed to offer maximum variability to participants, with two, three and five-day modules.  It s a flexible training setting tailored both to expertise levels and project-specific subject areas,  Kross explains. The idea for the program was born when the department noticed an increased demand for GIS skills training outside of the traditional 13-week theory-intensive course currently offered. In the summer certificate course, participants will learn how to use free GIS open-source software, collect and analyze their data and turn that information into visual representations that will help them effectively communicate. Storytelling is also a curriculum component.  They will learn how to tell stories using online mapping tools,  Kross says. In addition, participants will be exposed to a range of GIS projects led by the department s faculty, as well as by others enrolled in the program.  This will certainly expand the horizons of the participants in terms of what it is possible to achieve with GIS.  Networking opportunities and one-on-one consultations with subject-area specialists who use GIS in their research will be available throughout the program. Kross believes the new program will have broad appeal.  With things like smartphones and GPS devices, GIS is becoming increasingly necessary to many people and professional areas that have not traditionally used it,  she explains. Kross says the program will also hold appeal for those who need it for their research, a work requirement or professional development. Potential participants could include biology students who want to map disease, business students who want to pursue geography-related commercial opportunities and NGO members interested in community mapping.  Any student and professional with the beginning of an idea or a project involving geographic data would certainly benefit from this course.  While the program is just getting started, Kross sees potential for growth.  I am excited about the possibilities,  says Kross.  GIS is a fast-growing area, and with this program we will be able to quickly respond to the specific research and professional development needs of the participants.    The summer Geographic Information Systems (GIS) certification program runs from May 30 to June 3. Space is limited, and participants are encouraged to  sign up now . The cost for students and non-governmental organization (NGO) members is $100 per day, and the regular cost to participants is $375 per day.

On May 2, Canadians began receiving access codes to complete the questionnaire online by May 10. So many people rushed to the Statistics Canada census page that the site went down for 45 minutes . The census collects demographic information on every person in Canada. That data is used by governments, businesses, community organizations and others to make decisions at all levels. One in four households received the 36-page long-form questionnaire. The rest of Canadians will fill out the 10-question version. Both are mandatory. Zachary Patterson , associate professor in the Department of Geography, Planning, Environment , studies modelling of transportation, the environment, land-use and their linkages.  We asked him about the 2016 census and what it means for our nation.   Should Canadians be excited about this census? Zachary Patterson: Yes, they should. While the 2011 census was consistent and comparable with previous censuses, the National Household Survey was not. The National Household Survey replaced the \"Long form\" of the census. The NHS and Long form of the census collect more detailed information (revenues, ethnic background, employment status, sector of employment, etc.) on households than the census that collects basic information (number of people, ages, genders, etc.). Whereas the Long form of the census (administered to one in five households) was obligatory, the National Household Survey was not. This meant that its results were not comparable with previous information from previous censuses. As a result, this census will be the first time we will have comparable data about many aspects of the lives of Canadians in 10 years. In this digital information-gathering age, is a census still necessary? Doesn't Amazon (for example) have more useful and/or personal information about us? ZP: A census acts as a statistical/socio-demographic ground truth. Without the information provided by a census (i.e. the characteristics of an entire population), it is difficult to put many other types of data in to context   i.e. establish whether they are representative and what they actually represent. If one wants to make inferences about the Canadian population at almost any geographic level (country, province, CMA, census tract) knowledge of the characteristics of the population is necessary. Suppose you wanted to know how many people in the country owned a smartphone. To do this you sampled 1,000 people from across the country. If 800 of those people had a smartphone, how could you estimate how many people in the country had them without knowing the actual population? For the time being, a census is the most practical way to collect such information. There are other alternatives that may in the future be a feasible replacement, but they are fraught with difficulties. Many companies now collect a lot of information on their clients and users. Supposing a smartphone manufacturer collected information on phone owners. First, they probably don't have all information that would typically be collected in a census   they may know (or infer) gender and possibly age, but probably wouldn't know very much about occupation, education, revenue, etc. Second, not everyone has a smartphone, and no smartphone manufacturer makes all smartphones. As a result, it would be difficult to make inferences about the entire population just from smartphone information. It may be possible someday (as is done in some Scandinavian countries) to collect most required census information from existing datasources (e.g. income tax, provincial health insurance, etc.). At the same time, these sources are not necessarily comprehensive (not everyone files taxes), it may be difficult for the federal government to get information from data sources within provincial jurisdiction (e.g. health insurance records). As with the smartphone example above, there is also the problem of missing data. If, for example, people with lower revenues file taxes less, this would provide a distorted picture of revenues. Does census information assist your research and/or teaching at Concordia? If so, then how? ZP: Absolutely. Most of my research in one way or another requires census information. Statistics Canada told the CBC that  May 10 is not a hard deadline for filling out the cenus. However, the government organization is encouraging Canadians to complete the questionnaire as soon as possible in the coming days.

It was a celebration of collaborative design, and a chance to check out some cool new ideas for Montreal s parks. On April 28, Students and professors from Concordia and the Universit  de Montr al, and residents of the C te-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce (CDN NDG) borough gathered to mark the end of the first phase of an initiative to redesign two of its most popular green spaces. The project was conceived of as a way to build bridges between the borough s two districts, while drawing on the strengths of its universities. For part of it, 30 students from Concordia s Department of Geography, Planning and Environment were asked to re-imagine the site in front of the chalets of Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Park, on the corner of Girouard Avenue and Sherbrooke Street West, and Kent Park, on the corner of C te-des-Neiges Road and Kent Avenue.  From the beginning, we insisted that we shouldn't have a competition among the students, but instead work with them and the community in collaboration,  says Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor in the department, who was the university s lead academic on the project.  The outcome could be, for example, a monument, a plaza or an art installation,  says De la Llata.  The spaces will be completed and inaugurated in mid-2017 in the context of the city s 375th anniversary.  A user-driven design exercise The 30 Concordia students collaborated with 40 members of the public in a  design charrette,  consisting of two day-long sessions on-site at the parks  chalets.  A charrette is an intensive participatory design exercise in which professionals, scholars and/or students facilitate the visioning and conceptualization of an urban space or a project through a dialogue with the community,  De la Llata explains.  We had young people, elders, single and married people, dog owners, children, artists, and engineers. Each of them gave different inputs. Some mothers, for example, reported they would want to be able to watch their children in the playground but at the same time relax and have tea or coffee near the chalet.  Mainly, though, the design groups determined from the community members' input that they liked what was going on in the park already, De la Llata says. \"That is where the idea of the versatile/flexible platform came from   a space that is delivered to the community for them to transform, adapt and complete depending on the circumstances and needs.\" Jasmine Ali, an undergraduate student in  Urban Planning  and member of the Groupe NDG design team, says the involvement of the community was a key part of the process. \"It's their park, they go to it, they know more about it than us.\" In-situ design  A key idea behind the challenge was to plan the space from within the space itself, De la Llata says, explaining that the participants used ribbons, boxes and other items to delineate where elements of the design would be located.  This methodology, which we call  planning-in-situ,  is completely experimental   a method that democratizes urban design and planning. It involves conversations, presentations, walking tours, video-photographic analysis and sketching.\" At the end of the project, the Concordia students nominated two of their classmates, Ali and Faizan Jaffar   to receive internships worth $2,000 each. They ll work with the borough this summer to develop the park projects. \"I'm very grateful for this opportunity and looking forward to starting my internship,\" Ali says. \"As for my future plans, I'm looking towards continuing my education and doing a masters specifically in urban design.\" Jasmine Ali (pictured with borough mayor Russell Copeman) and Faizan Jaffar will receive internships worth $2,000 to develop the park projects. | Photos by Jean Beaudin for C te-des-Neiges Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce Students from Universit  de Montr al s  landscape architecture department  also participated in a separate design charrette. Five teams from UdeM spent a weekend in Benny Library putting together their proposals. The first-place team was awarded a prize of $2,500, while the second-place team received $1,500.    A sense of unity and belonging   There was a lot of collegial and friendly collaboration among professors from UdeM and Concordia in the planning of the whole exercise,  De la Llata says.  We had meetings with city officials from the borough. They were very responsive to our proposals and adapted the exercise to suit the different needs of each school.  Borough mayor Russell Copeman, a Concordia alum and former associate vice-president of the university, was on hand to award prizes at the special event, held at La maison de la Culture C te-des-Neiges. The projects presented by the students from Concordia and UdeM are remarkable, said Copeman.  They fit directly into our vision for the 375th anniversary of Montreal, to support the sense of unity and belonging to all the citizens of our neighbourhoods, and to the common history of Montreal and our borough.\" For De la Llata, the experience illustrated the value of collaboration. \"It brings out the best in people,\" he says.  We're really proud of ourselves, as well as the community members of NDG and CDN, and everybody who participated in this project.   The spirit of this exercise is that these two public spaces, in which students and members of the community have collectively contributed their ideas, represent the union between two culturally and historically distinct neighbourhoods,  he adds.  It s a constructive dialogue between the past and the future of Montreal.  For more information, check out the  C te-des-Neiges Notre-Dame-de-Gr ce borough website  and Facebook page.

Zika virus? With GIS, you may find Mayan ruins   and more Concordia expert Angela Kross explains why the application of geographic information systems (GIS) has no limits Posted on May 12, 2016 | By: Angela Kross This ingenious use of GIS generated global excitement. | Photo by William Gadoury Earlier this week, a 15-year-old Quebecer made international headlines when it seemed he had discovered the  site of a lost Mayan city  using satellite imagery and star maps. Experts  have since raised doubts , but that doesn't detract from his innovative use of geographic information systems (GIS). Here  Angela Kross  director of Concordia's new  GIS summer certification course  explains why it's the way of the future.   Concordia's Angela Kross | Photo by David Ward 'GIS helps us understand places' The story about the ingenious teen who developed a hypothesis about the location of major Mayan sites in relation to major stars is fascinating. According to  different news sources , William Gadoury used transparent overlays of star charts and known Mayan site maps. When one major star did not match any site, he used satellite images to explore the location further. The process he used to develop and test his hypothesis involves some very typical and conventional geographic information system (GIS) tasks: the use of map overlays and satellite remote sensing. Satellite images allow us to observe and measure objects anywhere on earth, but interpretations need to be careful and validated. The satellite images in this case, for example, revealed a set of geometric structures (e.g. rectangles) under the vegetation canopy. It is hard to attribute these structures to natural phenomena. Man-made structures such as the Maya temples could cause such features in the images. But so could old abandoned agriculture fields, for example (or something else). Only a field expedition could give a true validation of this hypothesis, which could become a very difficult and expensive process. This is where GIS and remote sensing can play a very important role. For example, if the features were indeed caused by an old agriculture/corn field, satellite images of 5, 10 or 20 years ago could help explain the nature of the observed features. Spatial data and maps of communities that live around that area (if they exist) or maps of agriculture activities in that area would also help us understand whether the features could be caused by recent activities. All this information (satellite images and maps) can be displayed and analyzed using free open source or proprietary GIS software.   5 great uses of GIS The application of GIS has no limitations, as long as we have spatial information (location, location, location!). GIS can play a powerful role in assisting scientists, business specialists and community organizations validate hypotheses and communicate information and research from many domains. Biology and environmental health specialists, for example, may want to map the distribution of the Zika vector (mosquitoes) habitat worldwide. Will increasing temperatures push the boundaries of those habitats? An urban planner may want to map green spaces in the city to evaluate the need for increased green areas. A high school teacher may want to teach history classes using GIS storytelling: attaching dates to places and photos; all on Google Earth for example. An NGO may want to collect information from aboriginal communities to map the most important lands, according to them (participatory GIS). A transport company may want to know if their existing routes are actually covering the needs of the consumers. Where would new services be needed? GIS helps us to understand places, to detect and understand spatial patterns and to determine relationships between variables over time and space. GIS plays an important role in bridging multiple disciplines, and in enabling collaboration using one platform.

Concordia expert Rosemary Collard weighs in on the debate Posted on May 20, 2016 | By: Rosemary Collard Photo by AV Design (Flickr Creative Commons) Rosemary Collard is an assistant professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment at Concordia.   Would you take an arsenic pill to cure a skin problem? Squeeze into a corset so tight it could kill you over time? These popular trends of the Victorian age have thankfully fallen out of favor. Now it s time to let go of one more vestige of that bygone era: horse-drawn carriages. The City of Montreal took a step in that direction this week when Mayor Denis Coderre announced a year-long moratorium on cal ches   the horse-drawn carriages that carry people   mostly tourists   around Old Montreal. The city s 24 carriage operators will be reimbursed for the cost of their operation permits, which have been suspended. The 56 cal che horses who live and work in Montreal have been the subject of fierce debate between tourism officials, members of the public, animal advocates and the horses' owners. This debate bubbles up almost annually, every time a horse collapses in the street, or collides with a car, as was the case last month in Griffintown . Advocates of the cal che industry say that the horses are part of the city s identity, a source of employment and a draw for tourists. They point to city veterinarians who have reportedly found that the horses  health has improved since the city has taken measures to regulate the industry over the last few years. These measures include bylaws to  protect  the horses, like requirements that they not work in above-30 degree weather, and that they rest at least six hours a day. But even if these bylaws are enforced, horses can still be worked 18 hours a day in 29-degree heat. Under the law, the cal che horses are property, equivalent to the cars with which they share the busy streets. Of course, unlike cars, horses are living, social creatures. The cal che horses are better thought of as workers, but workers who receive no compensation beyond the basic provisions for their survival. They are workers who are exposed to dangerous working conditions, navigating the traffic, construction zones and exhaust of modern city streets. They are workers who, now unemployed for the year, will hopefully be sent to a refuge rather than a slaughterhouse, as cal che operators are threatening . The province of Quebec recently passed a bill that defines animals as sentient beings. This bill responds to a cultural shift underway, in which the designations of animals as property are archaic, like the cal che industry. Following this bill and the lead of other major cities like Paris and Beijing, Montreal should extend the cal che moratorium into a permanent ban, relinquishing a punishing practice that long ago went out of date.

We did it just to see the bands we wanted to see. The bands would come to Montreal, they d sleep on our floor and we d do all the work,  Farkas says.  I never thought this would become an actual job, but I co-founded Greenland Productions in 1993 and did that for a few years. I had a chance to make a real living at it, and it s been nonstop ever since.  The Hamilton-born, Montreal-raised Farkas is now vice president of Concerts and Events for Montreal concert promotion and production company evenko , which presented  1,300 shows last year from Vermont to Newfoundland,  Farkas reports.

With Osheaga, we have reached the point 11 years in where we have a much bigger office, a much bigger team. But it s very uniting in terms of business: we are 100 per cent in control of the creative, the production and who we book,  he says.  There are various people in the booking department of various ages   me being the oldest   and everybody fights for the bands they would like to see at the festival. It s a very long process. There are 110 acts on the bill and we want every act to be the best act possible.  Farkas recalls:  We used to sit in a room with a board with band names cut out on pieces of paper and we moved them around in the schedule to find the best order possible. Now we re a bit more savvy and do it with computers. But we still strategize the same way   we look at every slot and we really try to gap it so you can catch 10 minutes of this, and 15 minutes of that. I love the idea of people discovering new music and running from one stage to another.  Lana Del Rey is one of the headliners at the 11th edition of Osheaga, July 29 to 31, 2016. The 11th edition of Osheaga , July 29 to 31, features headliners Lana Del Rey, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Radiohead.  We booked Radiohead in Montreal for the first time at the 500-capacity club Woodstock back in 1993,  says Farkas.  We were literally doing Nirvana that same night at the Verdun Auditorium and raced uptown to catch the end of Radiohead! That was how you did it back then   you played a club, then came back to play the next size up.  Farkas, a married father of a five-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter   both of whom are also Osheaga veterans   credits his years at Concordia for helping him grow his career.

I was booking shows on the side and working as a bike messenger,  says Farkas.  Did I devote myself to my studies? Nope, but it was important to me and my future to get a degree,  he says.  I hate starting things and not finishing them. I got a lot out of it, learnt critical thought, and solidified my way of looking at stuff.  Farkas adds:  Today I am living a dream. I remember my father telling me as a teenager,  If you can find a job that you wake up every morning and want to go to, then you re ahead of 95 per cent of the people in the world.  And I wake up in the morning and want to go to work every day.  The Osheaga Music and Arts Festival runs July 29 to 31 at Parc Jean-Drapeau.

Two Concordia researchers have revealed alarming growth patterns. Here are their solutions Posted on July 6, 2016 | By: Cl a Desjardins An example of urban sprawl around the autoroute 15 and 40 interchange. | Photos by Craig Townsend With more than half of the world s population now living in cities, urban sprawl is a growing problem   particularly in North America, where single-family homes and two-car garages are common. But it s also an increasing concern in various European countries, where living large is becoming more and more attractive. Just how fast are cities increasing in size? And are there ways for us to slow their expansion? New research from Concordia shows that there s indeed a lot more we could be doing to combat urban sprawl   and European countries are leading the way. Measuring and mapping  Before we can put a stop to urban sprawl, it s important to understand how to reliably measure it,  says Concordia geography professor Jochen Jaeger , co-author* of a recent joint European Environment Agency / Federal Office for the Environment report.  To do that, we developed a metric called Weighted Urban Proliferation   or WUP. It takes into account how much of an area is built up, the spatial dispersion of the built-up areas, and how many people live or work in a given place.  Once Jaeger and his co-authors had developed the WUP method, the research team combed through detailed data sets on 32 European countries to map out general trends and pinpoint problem areas. They found that large parts of Europe are affected by urban sprawl, with the lowest levels in Iceland and the highest in the Netherlands and Belgium. At a more granular level, sprawl is most pronounced in wide rings around city centres, along large transport corridors and along coastlines. The lowest levels of sprawl are mainly associated with mountain ranges or remote areas   hence Iceland s ranking.  This is the first report to provide a comparable measurement of urban sprawl for all EU and European Free Trade Association countries. It clearly shows that the rate of sprawl is increasing, and confirms there is an urgent need for action,  says Jaeger. On this side of the pond In North America, the situation is worse. In Montreal and Quebec City, urban sprawl is increasing at an exponential rate, according to a study co-authored by recent Concordia graduate, Naghmeh Nazarnia. Using the WUP method, she compared the two cities and found that urban sprawl has accelerated continuously since 1951, with the fastest increases taking place in the last 25 years. In Montreal, the degree of urban sprawl went up 26-fold from 1971 to 2011, while in Quebec City, it rose ninefold.  Compare these levels to a European city like Zurich, and you ll see the opposite trend. Here in Quebec, the fastest increases in sprawl have been observed in the last 25 years, whereas there the strongest acceleration was in the 1960s. This comparative analysis can help land-use planners control urban sprawl. The WUP method can also be used to establish targets and limits, and to see how effective those control measures are,  says Nazarnia.   Urban sprawl in Laval. Less sprawl, but not more high-rises The researchers caution that if we want to stop the exponential increase, we have to take action now. But the solution is not to build more high-rises. Simply put, the best solution is to use and re-use land sparingly. For Jaeger and Nazarnia, a combination of measures work best: Brownfield recycling   repurposing land previously used for industrial purposes, which has huge potential in cities with industrial pasts like Montreal. Careful population densification. Transit-oriented development through better coordination between transport ministries and cities. Stronger planning legislation. Nazarnia notes that these measures are already being undertaken in Europe.  Zurich, for example, has stronger planning legislation, much higher levels of public transportation and much lower levels of road traffic than Montreal and Quebec,  she says. In fact, some innovations are already taking place on both sides of the Atlantic to stop urban sprawl, Jaeger points out.  One great example is the Alternative Bank of Switzerland,  which will not give mortgages  to development projects that contribute strongly to an increase in urban sprawl. Another is the Canadian government s  recent move  to halt a construction project in a Montreal suburb in order to  protect chorus frogs ,  he says.  These are steps in the right direction, and hopefully a sign of things to come. We have set official limits on air pollution and water pollution. Why not set similar limits on urban sprawl?  *Partners in research: The study about urban sprawl in Europe was funded in part by the Swiss Confederation, with additional support from the European Environment Agency.

How can we find solutions to the world s pressing societal and environmental problems? One way is to provide free education on international issues on a global scale. So, beginning this fall, Concordia is teaming up with the United Nations to offer its first-ever Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), designed to help global citizens answer this sort of question.   Wicked Problems, Dynamic Solutions: The Ecosystem Approach and Systems Thinking   is an interdisciplinary course open to all. Anyone who is interested will have the opportunity to learn about complex ideas such as ecological resilience, environmental governance, urban biodiversity and the impact of climate change in an accessible way.  While there are many MOOCs out there that introduce ecosystem services and related topics, this is one of the first that focuses explicitly on the ecosystem approach, long adopted as desirable by the UN, while covering so many key ecosystems and overarching themes  explains Peter Stoett , director of the Loyola Sustainability Research Centre (LSRC). A Canadian first The Education Department of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi contacted Stoett last year about the possibility of setting up a MOOC together. He immediately set about securing the support of colleagues from across the university.  This is the first time Concordia has worked with the UN on a major online educational project,  Stoett says, adding that Concordia s partnership with UNEP on a large-scale MOOC is also a first for a Canadian university. The Department of Geography, Planning and Environment (GPE) will host the course, which will feature speakers from both GPE and LSRC, including Stoett and fellow researchers in the areas of environment and sustainability,   Damon Matthews , Annie Lalancette , Katja Neves, and Pascale Biron   all of whom helped to develop various aspects of the course. Concordia experts will be joined by international colleagues from UNEP in Nairobi and elsewhere.  We are very excited about this initiative and proud to be associated with a MOOC that has been so thoughtfully and collaboratively designed and developed,\" says Monica Mulrennan , Associate Professor and Chair of GPE. Always eager to provide Concordia students with exciting options,  Stoett and FAS Dean Andr  Roy ensured that the initiative will include a course credit option  ( GEOG 298   Selected Topics in Geography ), in a blended-learning format   partly online and partly in the classroom.  This will provide a greatly enriched opportunity for students to engage with the material they ve been exposed to through the MOOC and take it further,  says Mulrennan. Facilitating international dialogue The MOOC is being produced in partnership with KnowledgeOne, the digital learning developer for all of Concordia s online courses. CEO Robert Beauchemin says there was a steep learning curve involved, referring to the technical complexity of the powerful Open edX platform adopted for the course.  We are eager to step up to the challenge of seeing this project succeed.  For those wishing to take the online-only course, registration is free and open to all. A high-school level education is recommended.  The MOOC will provide the opportunity for students and professionals from across the world to interact,  says LSRC Co-ordinator Rebecca Tittler .  Participants will also be able to apply course material from their own geographic perspectives.  For example, the course includes interactive mapping exercises which ask students to post pictures from their neighbourhood and then link them to similar pictures from elsewhere. The course will also have an active online discussion board to facilitate international dialogue about the issues being taught.  Wicked Problems, Dynamic Solutions  was designed to be open to as many people as possible.  It is all about accessibility,  says Stoett.  Thousands of individuals from various age groups and backgrounds can take the course.  Available on your mobile One other crucial element   people can follow the course on their cell phones.  This is important because in many places around the world, cell phones may be a lot more accessible than computers,  explains Tittler. Both Mulrennan and Stoett agree it will be important to pay close attention to how this initial MOOC works in practice, in case the university wants to plan for more of them in the future.  The course is considered a pilot project this fall,  says Stoett.  After that, we will revisit the entire production and teaching process and strive to improve it.  For now, with registration up and running, enthusiasm for the course is high. The university is already committed to developing another UNEP-based MOOC for 2017, and discussions are ongoing around a third option.  We are certainly teaching for tomorrow with MOOCs and blended-learning approaches,  Stoett says.  But more importantly, we are teaching the basics of an ecosystem approach that will be vital to the survival of future generations.  Learn more about the course or register.  Concordia students wishing to take the blended course can register online via the MyConcordia portal.  The course begins on Monday, September 12.

How will we cope with rising sea levels and climbing temperatures? But it's not just humans who will be affected by these worldwide shifts   it's our closest cousins, too: monkeys, apes and lemurs. A new Concordia study published in the International Journal of Primatology shows that the world's primate populations may be seriously impacted by climate change. \"Our research shows that climate change may be one of the biggest emerging threats to primates, compounding existing pressures from deforestation, hunting and the exotic pet trade,\" says Tanya Graham, the article's lead author and an MSc student in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment . She worked with environment professor Damon Matthews from Concordia and primatology post-doctoral researcher Sarah Turner from McGill to assess the exposure and potential vulnerability of all non-human primate species to projected future temperature and precipitation changes. They found that overall, 419 species of non-human primates   such as various species of lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, monkeys and apes  will experience 10 per cent more warming than the global average, with some primate species experiencing increases of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in annual average temperature for every degree of global warming. The researchers also identified several hotspots of primate vulnerability to climate change, based on the combination of the number of species, their endangered status and the severity of climate changes at each location. Overall, the most extreme hotspots, which represent the upper 10 per cent of all hotspot scores, cover a total area of 3,622,012 square kilometres over the ranges of 67 primate species. The highest hotspot scores occur in Central America, the Amazon and southeastern Brazil, as well as portions of East and Southeast Asia   prime territory for some of the globe's best-known primates who call these areas home. The ursine howler monkey, black howler monkey, and barbary macaque are expected to be exposed to the highest magnitude of climate change when both temperature and precipitation are considered. For example, the ursine howler monkey, found in Venezuela, will experience an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius annually and a 5.3 per cent decline in annual rainfall for each degree of global temperature increase. \"This study highlights the vulnerability of individual species, as well as regions in which primates as a whole may be vulnerable to climate change,\" says Matthews, who will present the findings of this study during the Joint Meeting of the International Primatological Society and the American Society of Primatologists in Chicago later this month. \"Our findings can be taken as priorities for ongoing conservation efforts, given that any success in decreasing other current human pressures on endangered species may also increase that species  ability to withstand the growing pressures of climate changes,  says Graham.  Primates are often seen as flagship species for entire ecosystems, so conservation can have important ramifications for many other species too. I hope our study will help direct conservation efforts for individual primate species in particular, but also for vulnerable ecosystems in general throughout the tropical regions inhabited by non-human primates,\" adds Turner. Partners in research: This study was funded in part by the Concordia Institute for Water, Energy and Sustainable Systems, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Fonds de recherche du Qu bec   Nature et technologies.

Damon Matthews:  A fantastic opportunity.  This is the question to which Damon Matthews , Concordia University Research Chair for Climate Science and Sustainability and professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment , has dedicated himself for well over a decade. Considered a leader in his field, Matthews researches climate systems, climate change and environmental modelling. Now this work has earned him a top national honour   membership in the Royal Society of Canada s College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists . Formed in 2014 to recognize intellectual leaders and pioneers in Canada from a variety of fields, the college already boasts the membership of four Concordia researchers   Steven High , Erin Manning and Vincent Martin were included in the inaugural cohort, and Muthukumaran Packirisamy was inducted last year. Matthews is immensely honoured to represent Concordia within the college.  This is a fantastic opportunity to meet and interact with a group of really interesting young scholars and researchers,  Matthews says.  I m especially grateful to Concordia for their role in putting my nomination forward   this university has been a wonderful environment in which to build my academic career, and I would like to thank the many people here who have supported me both personally and professionally.  Through his research, Matthews has shown how each emission of carbon dioxide leads to a discrete and essentially irreversible increase in world temperatures. This work has improved understandings of the science of climate change, its impacts on human and environmental systems and how best to respond to the challenge of climate mitigation.  Recognition from a prestigious body like the Royal Society of Canada is extremely gratifying,  says Graham Carr, interim provost and vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.  The fact that Concordia faculty members continue to receive this honour is a further demonstration of the important contributions that our research makes to the betterment of Canadian society.  Concordia is also the institutional sponsor of the College, a tribute to the university's commitment to next-generation researchers.

Concordia professor  Zachary Patterson  is teaming up with the City of Montreal to launch MTLTrajet , a mobile app that will help the city learn more about how its citizens navigate from point A to point B.  I wanted to be able to undertake transportation and land-use research using emerging data sources,  says Patterson, an associate professor of geography, planning and environment in the  Faculty of Arts and Science.  However, getting ahold of this kind of data proved difficult. So, using smartphones, I developed an app to collect my own data.  DataMobile The app initially launched as  DataMobile , a 2014 pilot project. Close to 900 people downloaded the app, which prompted them to take part in a survey before it recorded their trips throughout the day using their smartphone. Developed at Concordia s  TRIP Lab , the app asked users for information such as their purpose of travel and chosen mode of transport.  Its purpose was to test how well we can use smartphones to collect travel data for transportation planning purposes,  says Patterson. The app proved popular, and was used in studies as far away as Ghana. Closer to home, it will be used in five Canadian cities   Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax   as part of this fall's  Canada Food Study . MTLTrajet The City of Montreal became interested when Patterson was a mentor at  MTL Cycle Challenge  (MCC), an initiative designed to improve cycling in the city by using data sets to create urban mobility solutions. At MCC, Patterson discussed the DataMobile project with representatives from the city's transport department and the  Montr al, Smart City  initiative.  The city is very enthusiastic about the adoption of new technologies in transport-related data collection,  says Patterson. After he was invited to give a presentation on DataMobile for city officials, they asked him to use it as the basis of MTLTrajet. In advance of its October 17 launch, the app is already generating plenty of buzz, on the streets and at City Hall.  It has been great working with the city,  says Patterson.  Converting data to information How will the results help advance Patterson s research? MTLTrajet will help Patterson and other researchers  figure out how to convert mere data to information.   It s a potentially effective tool because almost everyone carries around smartphones that know where they are, which can collect crucial transportation data,  says Patterson. He emphasizes the app s data collection is transparent.  The process is completely overt, so that respondents will know what data is being collected from them.  In the long term, Patterson s goal is to gather enough data to develop algorithms that will make it unnecessary to have any user input at all. Additional studies are already being planned by the University of Toronto, the  Institut national de recherche scientifique  s Montreal office, the  Agence m tropolitaine de transport ,  BIXI , the  STM  and the  Quebec  Ministry of Transport .  A travel survey collection effort is also being developed in Lahore, Pakistan. So, if you ve spent your summer playing Pok mon GO and are craving a new smartphone pastime while out and about, MTLTrajet may just be your new fall fix.  They both operate on smartphones and keep track of the location of the phone,  admits Patterson.  But it is different, in that it's not a game   and uses less battery, I hope!

How does the public space surrounding the downtown campus define us as a university community? This is a question addressed in the eighth instalment of the Quartier Concordia series , currently exhibited in the vitrines of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV). Public Spaces and Gathering Places highlights the creation of Norman Bethune Square as a gathering point for numerous rallies, the use of Mackay Street as a concert ground and the recent development of Zone  ducation Culture on Bishop Street. Clarence Epstein, senior director of Urban and Cultural Affairs at Concordia, points out that people have come together around the university   in Stanley Cup parades, demonstrations, performances and cultural events   mostly in spaces not designed as gathering places.  Following the construction of Cabot Square in the late 19th century, very little priority was given to public space planning,  he says.  What we recognize as gathering places have appeared as a result of the way the neighbourhood has evolved. They ve been appropriated by the various people and organizations who live in and occupy these spaces.   Proactive changes  Now, the planning of new public areas is a priority for the city s administration and local stakeholders, including the university. In tandem with the new exhibition, Concordia joined with the City of Montreal s Department of Public Works to launch a visioning charrette to engage the entire community in determining the future of the alley that runs south of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) between Mackay and Bishop streets. A charrette is a participatory design program allowing professionals, scholars and students to join community stakeholders in discussing and visualizing the possibilities for an urban space.  We understand from the City of Montreal that this space is going to change,  Epstein says, noting that municipal officials have also placed a reserve on an adjacent parcel of land slated for a park at the corner of Mackay and Ste-Catherine streets.  The goal of the charrette and other initiatives like it is to inform good design decisions through collective reflection and communication.  The LB Alley charrette took place on October 21 and 22 in the LB atrium, J.A. DeS ve Cinema and in the alley itself. The public was invited to engage in  planning-in-situ,  with walks-through, video-photographic analysis and community sketches. Discussions were led by Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor of geography, planning and environment in the Faculty of Arts and Science . He says the process encourages the public to plan spaces for themselves   from the spaces, because they are the ultimate users. From Modernism to democratization De la Llata explains that in the first half of the 20th century, the dominant approach to urban planning was Modernism, in which form followed the function architects believed spaces should have, rather than the way they were actually used. Modernist planners felt they knew best how people should behave, and built cities designed to coerce citizens into using spaces as they intended them to. According to De la Llata, this resulted in a wide array of urban planning disasters.  Modernist planning transformed cities in a way that wasn t very democratic,  he says.  The motivation here is democratization. We want to understand what qualities people want to see in the space, and to give a chance to Montrealers, the Concordia community, St. Jax Church, McKibbins Irish Pub and other restaurants and businesses on the periphery of the alley to participate in the planning and design of the space.

Damon Matthews is a geography, planning and environment professor and Concordia University Research Chair (Climate Science and Sustainability) in the Faculty of Arts and Science . Following the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on November 4, Matthews co-authored* an op-ed about what it will take for Canada to uphold its commitment to combatting climate change. The Paris Agreement was ratified earlier this month and is unprecedented amongst international agreements for how quickly it has come into force. This agreement allows each country to decide how it will tackle climate change and requires, as of 2020, regular reporting on progress. Countries of the world have officially embarked on a global race to implement ambitious climate policies that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the planetary scale. This process is not unlike the Olympic Games where countries get together to compare their strengths and performance. If Canada wants to be a medalist in 2020, domestic climate policies must rapidly be adopted to accelerate the low carbon transition. In this context, Sustainable Canada Dialogues   a network of 60+ scholars from across Canada   produced a progress report on the country s climate actions over the past year. We analyzed climate decisions made in Ottawa in 2016 in relationship to the 10 policy orientations that we proposed previously in our position paper entitled Acting on Climate Change: Solutions from Canadian Scholars . Canada took two important steps forward. First, the federal government will price carbon throughout the country starting in 2018. Second, the $120 billion infrastructure investment plan explicitly highlights support for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This investment plan raises hopes that Canada can make the transition to low carbon development, but its real impact depends on identifying and funding infrastructure projects that best contribute to desired low-carbon and sustainable outcomes. Despite this progress, the decision to approve the Pacific NorthWest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is a step backward, casting doubt on the willingness of the federal government to meaningfully tackle climate change. The impact assessment indicates that this LNG project would be one of the largest point source of emissions in Canada and would increase British Columbia s emissions by 8.5 per cent. Continued development of projects with high greenhouse gas emissions will compromise progress in other sectors. It will prevent Canada from meeting its emissions reduction target for 2030, and is incompatible with Canada s stated goal to help limit global temperature increases to 1.5oC. Research indeed estimates that, to maintain global temperature increase below 2oC, half of existing gas reserves and one third of existing oil ones must remain unused. Canadian climate policy must tackle the most difficult question: how to transition away from fossil fuels? We call for federal political leadership that steadily and strategically adopts innovative low-carbon tools to drive future economic growth. This requires engaging with a broad range of stakeholders from the oil and gas industry, unions, Indigenous peoples, environmental NGOs, the clean technology sector and academia to discuss how to reorient subsidies away from the fossil fuel industry, promote transitions to low-carbon energy, while ensuring that workers from the oil and gas industry can transition their skills to other sectors. Ambitious Canadian climate leadership is necessary more than ever in North America. Only by working together and building commitment across all sectors will Canada live up to the expectations it rose by joining the High Ambition Coalition in 2015. Despite positive steps, the federal government has been unable so far to develop a coherent climate action plan largely because of its inability to address fossil fuels coherently.

That s what faculty members and community representatives will team up to discuss at the next Beyond Disciplines event, taking place Thursday, December 1, on Concordia s Loyola Campus. Organized by Andr  Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS), in collaboration with the Office of Community Engagement, the series examines the role of mutual learning in research. Building bridges/Going beyond the walls will pair FAS faculty members and the community representatives they work with. Chedly Belkhodja , professor and principal of the School of Community and Public Affairs, is hosting the event.  Engaging with community is at the heart of what we do at the school,  he says.  It s wonderful to see the dean has chosen this topic.  Ann-Louise Davidson , an associate professor in Education, concurs.  The research we do is not contained inside the physical walls of the university.  The post-event reception will be hosted by Loyola s Hive Caf  Co-op , which serves a free sustainable lunch for the Loyola community every weekday. Attendees will also get to check out an art project facilitated by La Ruche d'Art NDG Art Hive .  We are thrilled to be participating. It s going to be a lot of fun,  says the Hive Caf  Co-op s events coordinator Paige Hilderman. The speakers include Davidson and her colleague, assistant professor  Giuliana Cucinelli , as well as Chris Colley and Christine Truesdale of LEARN Quebec , a group that helps minorities in the province s school system. Together they will discuss maker culture in an educational context.  Going beyond the walls means engaging in discussions to see how we can build synergies through concrete activities where true collaboration can exist,  Davidson says.  We are conducting research in a living lab. We might not all be playing the same roles, but we can speak to each other.  Eva Pomeroy , a lecturer in Applied Human Sciences, will be joined by C dric Jamet, a partner from percolab . Jamet co-designed and co-facilitated the Concordia ULab Social Innovation Hub , an experiment in transformative education that was launched this fall.  There is such incredible potential in partnering with the community,  says Pomeroy.  We can continuously co-create learning that is aligned with the needs of the world outside the university in the present moment.    Also at the December 1 event,  Anna-Liisa Aunio , an adjunct professor with the Loyola College for Diversity and Sustainability, will discuss her research on food justice sustainability with Ga lle Janvier of Alternatives Montreal. Monica Mulrennan , chair of the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment, will outline her work with Northern Cree populations alongside deputy grand chief Rodney Mark .  Meanwhile, Varda Mann-Feder , also in Applied Human Sciences, will profile her partnership with C.A.R.E. Jeunesse , an organization that helps youth who are transitioning out of government care. For Mann-Feder, community collaboration has been a transformative experience.  These young people have thrived against all odds and are the embodiment of resilience. It is very humbling for me as a researcher to work alongside them.  Beyond Disciplines: Building bridges/Going beyond the walls takes place at 5 p.m. on Thursday, December 1, in Room 110.00 of the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics (GE) on Concordia s Loyola Campus (7141 Sherbrooke St. W.). It is free, open to the public and wheelchair accessible. Please RSVP: RSVP.fas@concordia.ca .

He has taught Urban Design and Planning, Urban Sociology, Public Space Studios, History of Urbanism and Architecture, Architectural Studio and Environmental Psychology at The Autonomous University of Tamaulipas and Anahuac University in Mexico and Cornell University. He has studied contesting uses of public space, such as street vending, graffiti,public assembly and protest, as urban design/planning agents. His dissertation explores alternative planning processes in the context of protest encampments in horizontal social movements. He did research and participated in the Indignados mobilizations in Barcelona,Occupy Wall Street and other social movements in2011 and 2012.  Teaching activities URBS 333 - URBAN LABORATORY (Fall 2015 and Winter 2016) This course focuses on exploring urban planning/design strategies andtactics to  re-stitch    socially and physically   interstitial spaces thatcreate fragmentation in the urban fabric. It particularly focuses on urbaninfrastructure, such as elevated highways, multi-level vehicular intersections,(post)industrial complexes, railroads and railyards. The interruptions thatthese spaces create in the urban fabric are not only due to their physicalcondition, but also because there is a difference in the social, spatial andinstitutional scale. These spaces are often under national or provincialgovernment jurisdictions (i.e. highways and railroads) or even transnationalregulations (i.e. international corporations), and therefore are detached fromcommunity and neighborhood-level dynamics. The ultimate objective of the course is to explore the challenges andopportunities is to create city out of in interstitial spaces. To explore theseissue, this course will draw from theories that intersect community planning,urban acupuncture, landscape urbanism, infrastructure planning and public spacestudies as well as case studies around the world in which planners and urbandesigners have successfully (or unsuccessfully) dealt with these kinds ofproblems. It also draws from cultural landscape studies in order to understandthe socio-cultural divisions that are created by such urban conditions. Thecourse will focus on laboratory work on the case of the Saint Henri Quartier inMontreal, QC.  This neighborhood,delimited by Highway 720, the Lachine Canal and Atwater Avenue, has many of thecharacteristics described above, and it is an outstanding opportunity to testplanning/design and policy strategies for urban regeneration in fragmentedspaces. This formerly working-class and gentrifying neighborhood is fragmentedby postindustrial infrastructure that otherwise represented common spaces.However, its rich popular culture and history gives the neighborhood aresilience that enables for (re)appropriation and (re)signification of the space. The solutions suggested for this laboratory are not  major-surgery-like ones that require large demolitions and construction of existinginfrastructure, but rather mild interventions that can turn the socio-spatialdynamics around in the urban fabric. Interventions such as graffiti murals, artinstallations, farmer markets, community gardens, and events such as festivals,concerts or neighborhood meetings are particularly encouraged. The studentswill use community-engagement methods (i.e. participatory action research, filmprojections, charrettes, planning-in-situ, place-making) to test thesemethodologies in the selected sites.  URBS 490 - PUBLIC SPACE AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST (Winter 2016) Urban space shapes publics,and publics (re)shape urban space. Public space is the result of this dialecticrelationship. Public space is also the physical manifestation of the publicinterest, and therefore is also the manifestation of conflict. However, publicspace and the public sphere is also the realm to debate about and solve thoseconflicts. This seminar explores how the notion of the public and public spaceplays a key role in the construction of democratic societies. It broadlyexplores the socioeconomic, cultural, political and physical dimensions ofpublic space. It particularly focuses on the tensions between how space isproduced and how it is (re)appropriated and (re)produced by its citizens, withthe objective of drawing lessons to enable a more democratic, inclusive andjust city-making. Drawing form theory, history and case studies, thisseminar analyzes how public spaces are planned and how different subjectivitiesemerged from those spaces, as well as how these subjectivities transform andreinvent themselves to change the spaces they inhabit. The notions of exclusionand inclusion, gender/race/age/class equity, gentrification and privatizationof public space, problems and potential of social networks, protest and theright to the city, as well as place-making and community planning would bewidely explored. The course is divided into twoparts: 1. Typologies of public space and subjectivities   During the first part of the class, wewill analyze different types of spaces that encourage and discourage certainactivities in space and therefore create different subjectivities and ways of being-in-the-world  (e.g. plazas, parks, promenades, etc.) 2. Academic and Civic Debates on public space andthe public interest   In thesecond part of the course, we will analyze and build on the current debatesabout how to plan, manage, regulate, design, use and occupy public space (e.g.privatization of public space, gentrification, protest and occupation of publicspace, paradoxes of the social networks in public spaces, etc.) .  Publications Urban Resistance: Alternative Interpretations of Public Space (English/revised version) (2014) in Viladevall & Castrillo (2010), Espacio Publico en la Ciudad Contemporanea, Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Espa a. Abstract Drawing from a historical analysis of informal uses of urban space in Mexico, this chapter analyzes uses and interpretations of public spaces that clash with their planning and design programs. It particularly explores the notion of urban resistance, understood as alternative readings of space that contest urban regulations and spatial programs and, as practices that remain in spite of historical and cultural transformations. The chapter concludes by reinterpreting a modernist esplanade in a hospital and by providing design proposals that incorporate amenities and an informal market to an otherwise precarious space. Protest Encampments as Urban Laboratories: The 15M Barcelona Encampment: A Space of Resistance and Creativity (2014) in Progressive Planning, Planner's Network, New York, NY. Abstract The protest encampments of 2011 operated as spaces of resistance-through-creativity.Without an apparent overarching structure, the protesters engaged in different forms of interaction, encounter and organization. The spontaneous processes used to organize the physical space of the encampments provided lessons for the democratization of planning and city-making processes. Rather than in what was done in the encampments, the true lessons are more in how things were done  through mechanics that allowed potentially anyone from within or without the movement to actively participate in its development. To explore these ideas,this article makes a brief account of the case of the Barcelona Encampment in Plaza Catalunya in the Spring of 2011. Open-ended urbanisms: Space-making processes in the protest encampment of the Indignados movement in Barcelona (2015) in URBAN DESIGN International Abstract This paper studies the spontaneous and organic processes involved in the physical planning of protest encampments. Drawing from ethnographic work in the context of the Indignados Movement in Barcelona,it analyzes the spatial evolution and transformation of the Plaza Catalunya encampment in 2011. The encampments evolved in parallel to the conversations and questions that originated them online and offline. Thus, it particularly examines the notions of open planning (i.e. open-source and open-ended decision-making processes) and urban laboratories that the fieldwork indicates were tested in the space of the encampment. The objective is to understand how urban space can be planned through non-hierarchical space-making processes and without a homogeneous overarching structure. This paper situates in a larger discussion about alternative space-making processes such as insurgent, tactical planning,as well as in the recent conversations about open-source cities.

The TRIP lab is equipped with high-powered computers and servers for geographical and statistical analysis and is able to house up to 10 student researchers. It is also home to unique and expansive transportation and land-use data for Montreal as well as other major urban regions across the country. Analysis of this data is made possible by cutting-edge and sophisticated software for geographical analysis, transportation modeling and statistical analysis.

Reports of oil spills, pipeline and gas leaks, and nuclear power plant meltdowns appear almost mundane in their frequency. Research into these human-caused catastrophic events justifiably asks why or how they happened: what breakdowns in regulation, for example, or what human errors. But very little scholarship evaluates disaster aftermath. This is a critical gap. In the aftermath of environmental disasters the socio-ecological relations that constitute humankind and its political economies are brought into relief. During such upheaval, these relations can be challenged and re-thought or are reproduced. I am interested specifically in the reconfiguration of human-animal relations through disaster cleanup, a space-time in which wildlife management regimes are intensified through restoration and rehabilitation efforts that are funded by fines issued to guilty parties. This paper offers preliminary reflections on these regimes and a research program for investigating them. My analytic frame consists of Foucauldian ideas of biopower and pastoral power, a case study of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup in Alaska, and a driving question: what else besides oil does cleanup leave behind?

There is growing concern about the uncontrolled spread of residential, commercial and industrial areas, which is commonly called urban sprawl. In order to develop strategies to monitor and control urban sprawl, it is essential to know its drivers and its current state. Europe is a densely build-up continent and its diversity provides the ideal region to study urban sprawl and its potential drivers. In this study, we quantified urban sprawl in 39 European countries (excl. city states) at regional level using the classification of Nomenclature of Territorial Statistics (NUTS-2). We analyzed the role and importance of demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental drivers at the same level using Ridge Regression. We show that population density, road and railway density, and governmental effectiveness are the most important drivers of urban sprawl in Europe at the NUTS-2 level. Household size and the number of cars owned per person are less important, but play also a significant role in driving urban sprawl. These results suggest a focus on the demographic development and the development of the infrastructure in the first place in order to control urban sprawl. Additionally, political actions should take measures against urban sprawl into account when considering ways to increase prosperity. Finally, the life style should be directed towards a more sustainable development of settlement areas by making single-family dwellings less attractive and public transport services more attractive.

From the early days of the occupation, in addition to pursuing traditional justice mechanisms, prisoners have engaged in acts of extra-legal resistance, aimed at making the prison system itself unworkable. Actions have included the development of alternative institutions (such as political, financial, and educational systems within the prisons), noncooperation (such as refusing to comply with prison protocols), and prolonged hunger strikes. Such acts of resistance have had a reverberating effect, diffusing beyond the temporal and spatial boundaries of the physical prison institutions to influence policy and inspire local, national, and international activism. In this presentation, Dr. Julie Norman discusses the short and long term impacts of prison-based resistance among activist networks, examining how hunger strikes in particular resonate in unique ways from other forms of activism.

Example topics are the relationship between group rationality and individual rationality, the epistemic significance of disagreement, the difficulties for testing hypotheses in the social sciences, the impact of social structures on biological notions such as race, and the ethical considerations surrounding how race is used in science and society It has become common practice within the economic literature on climate change to model the problem of international greenhouse gas emissions game-theoretically as a so-called \"Tragedy of the Commons\".  If this choice of model is the correct one, we're in trouble the conditions under which such commons problems have historically been solved  are almost entirely absent in the case of international greenhouse gas emissions. While I believe that this model will support many accurate predictions, I don't believe this is necessarily a cause for concern. In this essay, I will argue that the predictive accuracy of the tragedy model stems from the model's ability to make self-fulfilling predictions within our current international setting. Each nation's expectation of self-interested actions on the parts of other members in the game, in effect, modifies each nation's behavior. I present some recent work in behavioral economics that offers a glimmer of hope. In particular, individuals don't typically act in what such models consider to be rationally self-interested ways.

This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract The region known as the Lower North Shore (LNS) consists of sixteen small communities spread along 400 km of coastline in northeastern Qu bec, Canada. Prompted by the collapse of its cod-fishing industry in the 1990s, the region has turned to place-branding strategies to encourage wilderness tourism as a form of economic renewal. This research creation thesis examines rubus chamaemorus, or the cloudberry, a local wild berry, as a contested cultural symbol in this process. The research question guiding this thesis asks: what are the effects of representations that are being used in efforts to stimulate economic development on the Lower North Shore of Qu bec? In particular, I analyze how the cloudberry is being used as a symbol of wilderness and purity in current place-branding projects in the region. This image perpetuates a frontier myth that the land is empty and available for privatization. The persistence of this narrative is shown across a history of similar settler colonial projects that use wilderness as a trope to justify so-called  development  of Indigenous land. This thesis argues furthermore that a relational approach to the cloudberry challenges its representation as a fixed  object , understanding it instead as a nexus of lived relations that include a range of practices such as walking, cooking and camping, and a host of competing interests such as Concordia University, Universit  Laval, local development centres on the LNS, as well as Anglophone, Francophone and Innu communities there. Through storytelling, the significance of cloudberries in everyday life on the coast is foregrounded, thus indicating social and environmental forms of well-being that should be respected and encouraged in various partnerships that are currently being negotiated there. This research has involved building an immersive, interactive installation using projection mapping and voice recognition software.

This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract My thesis explores the processes of gaining deep knowledge about place through everyday travel. I focus on how different modes of mobility perform different kinds of spaces, views, and mental maps of the city, how the repetition of the daily routine enacts a personal archive of place, and how the functionalistic commute can be  detoured  into a meaningful practice. My creative research stems in part from my autoethnographic media practices of navigating the city, and frames the gathering of knowledge as an artistic experience that is integral to my methods of investigation. The commute is a unique and everyday liminal space, one that is ripe for artistic encounters and stories to materialize the city in transformative ways. By explicitly advocating an interventionist practice through mapping and locative art, I hope to contribute to the development of a more engaged commute as a hybrid space of pleasure and surprise. This project investigates three different and specific kinds of commutes. The first involves a walk between two very different neighbourhoods that involves crossing the controversial border that is the L Acadie Fence. I use cultural landscape methods of  reading  the built environment with an eye on the material, the social and the historical, as well as a photographic practice that documents and archives my daily journeys around the two neighbourhoods. The second commute relates the experience of city transit as a unique space of performance, both in the everyday ritual sense and as a space of social theatre. The ubiquity of mobile media in transit spaces is also addressed as having the potential to reconnect to one s surroundings, rather than disconnecting from the commuting routine. Finally, the third commute describes a drive from one city to another in rush hour traffic, combined with a look at Mikhail Bakhtin s chronotope as a method of cinematic analysis, and a way of discerning narratives that build up around the non-places of the auto-commute. This study will then conclude by presenting a framework for the detour as a practice of creative mapping through everyday travel. Where Room LB-646, J.W.

This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract This thesis is an interdisciplinary study of the norms and forms of everyday life in the historic quarter of Karachi, Pakistan, as they relate to the sovereign imaginaries that animate the way urban subjects inhabit the space of the city. It examines the evolution of the urban form of the city and shows how historical constructions of space, empire and nation structured present formulations of political subjectivity at the micro and macro levels. Using three disciplinary lenses history, anthropology and political science the study captures the diverse forces and sovereignties that have shaped ideas of life and the organization of space in a complex urban environment. Based on previously unexamined archival material and ethnographic field research in the historic inner city area of Karachi, it traces the effects of historic formations of the space of the city on the lived space of the streets and neighbourhoods. It locates the politics of space that unfolds in the streets and neighbourhoods of the city in significant shifts in its colonial and postcolonial history. In doing so it brings attention to the limits of biopolitical subject formation, where the processes of making social and political worlds in common exceed the state s attempt at discipline and subjugation. The social and political formations that were the object of this study, consist of different kinds of sovereign arrangements that attempt to rule and govern space in parallel to, and often overlapping with, state governance. These sovereign arrangements range from custom and kinship-based organizations to political and religious groups and movements that seek to establish norms around the social and spatial management of the neighbourhood. The finding of this study is that multiple sovereign assemblages act to both challenge and reproduce state sovereignty. These sovereignties operate in different domains   political, religious and clan-based social networks that constantly overlap and engage with the state to claim legitimacy and a share of urban resources. The most significant finding of this study is that sovereign imaginaries drawn upon by these arrangements go beyond the nation to draw upon histories and trajectories that are transregional and transcendental, bringing into question the nation-state s sole claim to territorial sovereignty.

How will we cope with rising sea levels and climbing temperatures? But it's not just humans who will be affected by these worldwide shifts   it's our closest cousins, too: monkeys, apes and lemurs. A new Concordia study published in the International Journal of Primatology shows that the world's primate populations may be seriously impacted by climate change. \"Our research shows that climate change may be one of the biggest emerging threats to primates, compounding existing pressures from deforestation, hunting and the exotic pet trade,\" says Tanya Graham, the article's lead author and an MSc student in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment . She worked with environment professor Damon Matthews from Concordia and primatology post-doctoral researcher Sarah Turner from McGill to assess the exposure and potential vulnerability of all non-human primate species to projected future temperature and precipitation changes. They found that overall, 419 species of non-human primates   such as various species of lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, monkeys and apes  will experience 10 per cent more warming than the global average, with some primate species experiencing increases of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in annual average temperature for every degree of global warming. The researchers also identified several hotspots of primate vulnerability to climate change, based on the combination of the number of species, their endangered status and the severity of climate changes at each location. Overall, the most extreme hotspots, which represent the upper 10 per cent of all hotspot scores, cover a total area of 3,622,012 square kilometres over the ranges of 67 primate species. The highest hotspot scores occur in Central America, the Amazon and southeastern Brazil, as well as portions of East and Southeast Asia   prime territory for some of the globe's best-known primates who call these areas home. The ursine howler monkey, black howler monkey, and barbary macaque are expected to be exposed to the highest magnitude of climate change when both temperature and precipitation are considered. For example, the ursine howler monkey, found in Venezuela, will experience an increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius annually and a 5.3 per cent decline in annual rainfall for each degree of global temperature increase. \"This study highlights the vulnerability of individual species, as well as regions in which primates as a whole may be vulnerable to climate change,\" says Matthews, who will present the findings of this study during the Joint Meeting of the International Primatological Society and the American Society of Primatologists in Chicago later this month. \"Our findings can be taken as priorities for ongoing conservation efforts, given that any success in decreasing other current human pressures on endangered species may also increase that species  ability to withstand the growing pressures of climate changes,  says Graham.  Primates are often seen as flagship species for entire ecosystems, so conservation can have important ramifications for many other species too. I hope our study will help direct conservation efforts for individual primate species in particular, but also for vulnerable ecosystems in general throughout the tropical regions inhabited by non-human primates,\" adds Turner. Partners in research: This study was funded in part by the Concordia Institute for Water, Energy and Sustainable Systems, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Fonds de recherche du Qu bec   Nature et technologies.

Damon Matthews:  A fantastic opportunity.  This is the question to which Damon Matthews , Concordia University Research Chair for Climate Science and Sustainability and professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment , has dedicated himself for well over a decade. Considered a leader in his field, Matthews researches climate systems, climate change and environmental modelling. Now this work has earned him a top national honour   membership in the Royal Society of Canada s College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists . Formed in 2014 to recognize intellectual leaders and pioneers in Canada from a variety of fields, the college already boasts the membership of four Concordia researchers   Steven High , Erin Manning and Vincent Martin were included in the inaugural cohort, and Muthukumaran Packirisamy was inducted last year. Matthews is immensely honoured to represent Concordia within the college.  This is a fantastic opportunity to meet and interact with a group of really interesting young scholars and researchers,  Matthews says.  I m especially grateful to Concordia for their role in putting my nomination forward   this university has been a wonderful environment in which to build my academic career, and I would like to thank the many people here who have supported me both personally and professionally.  Through his research, Matthews has shown how each emission of carbon dioxide leads to a discrete and essentially irreversible increase in world temperatures. This work has improved understandings of the science of climate change, its impacts on human and environmental systems and how best to respond to the challenge of climate mitigation.  Recognition from a prestigious body like the Royal Society of Canada is extremely gratifying,  says Graham Carr, interim provost and vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.  The fact that Concordia faculty members continue to receive this honour is a further demonstration of the important contributions that our research makes to the betterment of Canadian society.  Concordia is also the institutional sponsor of the College, a tribute to the university's commitment to next-generation researchers.

Concordia professor  Zachary Patterson  is teaming up with the City of Montreal to launch MTLTrajet , a mobile app that will help the city learn more about how its citizens navigate from point A to point B.  I wanted to be able to undertake transportation and land-use research using emerging data sources,  says Patterson, an associate professor of geography, planning and environment in the  Faculty of Arts and Science.  However, getting ahold of this kind of data proved difficult. So, using smartphones, I developed an app to collect my own data.  DataMobile The app initially launched as  DataMobile , a 2014 pilot project. Close to 900 people downloaded the app, which prompted them to take part in a survey before it recorded their trips throughout the day using their smartphone. Developed at Concordia s  TRIP Lab , the app asked users for information such as their purpose of travel and chosen mode of transport.  Its purpose was to test how well we can use smartphones to collect travel data for transportation planning purposes,  says Patterson. The app proved popular, and was used in studies as far away as Ghana. Closer to home, it will be used in five Canadian cities   Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax   as part of this fall's  Canada Food Study . MTLTrajet The City of Montreal became interested when Patterson was a mentor at  MTL Cycle Challenge  (MCC), an initiative designed to improve cycling in the city by using data sets to create urban mobility solutions. At MCC, Patterson discussed the DataMobile project with representatives from the city's transport department and the  Montr al, Smart City  initiative.  The city is very enthusiastic about the adoption of new technologies in transport-related data collection,  says Patterson. After he was invited to give a presentation on DataMobile for city officials, they asked him to use it as the basis of MTLTrajet. In advance of its October 17 launch, the app is already generating plenty of buzz, on the streets and at City Hall.  It has been great working with the city,  says Patterson.  Converting data to information How will the results help advance Patterson s research? MTLTrajet will help Patterson and other researchers  figure out how to convert mere data to information.   It s a potentially effective tool because almost everyone carries around smartphones that know where they are, which can collect crucial transportation data,  says Patterson. He emphasizes the app s data collection is transparent.  The process is completely overt, so that respondents will know what data is being collected from them.  In the long term, Patterson s goal is to gather enough data to develop algorithms that will make it unnecessary to have any user input at all. Additional studies are already being planned by the University of Toronto, the  Institut national de recherche scientifique  s Montreal office, the  Agence m tropolitaine de transport ,  BIXI , the  STM  and the  Quebec  Ministry of Transport .  A travel survey collection effort is also being developed in Lahore, Pakistan. So, if you ve spent your summer playing Pok mon GO and are craving a new smartphone pastime while out and about, MTLTrajet may just be your new fall fix.  They both operate on smartphones and keep track of the location of the phone,  admits Patterson.  But it is different, in that it's not a game   and uses less battery, I hope!  MTLTrajet launches on October 17.

How does the public space surrounding the downtown campus define us as a university community? This is a question addressed in the eighth instalment of the Quartier Concordia series , currently exhibited in the vitrines of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV). Public Spaces and Gathering Places highlights the creation of Norman Bethune Square as a gathering point for numerous rallies, the use of Mackay Street as a concert ground and the recent development of Zone  ducation Culture on Bishop Street. Clarence Epstein, senior director of Urban and Cultural Affairs at Concordia, points out that people have come together around the university   in Stanley Cup parades, demonstrations, performances and cultural events   mostly in spaces not designed as gathering places.  Following the construction of Cabot Square in the late 19th century, very little priority was given to public space planning,  he says.  What we recognize as gathering places have appeared as a result of the way the neighbourhood has evolved. They ve been appropriated by the various people and organizations who live in and occupy these spaces.   Proactive changes  Now, the planning of new public areas is a priority for the city s administration and local stakeholders, including the university. In tandem with the new exhibition, Concordia joined with the City of Montreal s Department of Public Works to launch a visioning charrette to engage the entire community in determining the future of the alley that runs south of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) between Mackay and Bishop streets. A charrette is a participatory design program allowing professionals, scholars and students to join community stakeholders in discussing and visualizing the possibilities for an urban space.  We understand from the City of Montreal that this space is going to change,  Epstein says, noting that municipal officials have also placed a reserve on an adjacent parcel of land slated for a park at the corner of Mackay and Ste-Catherine streets.  The goal of the charrette and other initiatives like it is to inform good design decisions through collective reflection and communication.  The LB Alley charrette took place on October 21 and 22 in the LB atrium, J.A. DeS ve Cinema and in the alley itself. The public was invited to engage in  planning-in-situ,  with walks-through, video-photographic analysis and community sketches. Discussions were led by Silvano De la Llata , assistant professor of geography, planning and environment in the Faculty of Arts and Science . He says the process encourages the public to plan spaces for themselves   from the spaces, because they are the ultimate users. From Modernism to democratization De la Llata explains that in the first half of the 20th century, the dominant approach to urban planning was Modernism, in which form followed the function architects believed spaces should have, rather than the way they were actually used. Modernist planners felt they knew best how people should behave, and built cities designed to coerce citizens into using spaces as they intended them to. According to De la Llata, this resulted in a wide array of urban planning disasters.  Modernist planning transformed cities in a way that wasn t very democratic,  he says.  The motivation here is democratization. We want to understand what qualities people want to see in the space, and to give a chance to Montrealers, the Concordia community, St. Jax Church, McKibbins Irish Pub and other restaurants and businesses on the periphery of the alley to participate in the planning and design of the space.

Damon Matthews is a geography, planning and environment professor and Concordia University Research Chair (Climate Science and Sustainability) in the Faculty of Arts and Science . Following the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on November 4, Matthews co-authored* an op-ed about what it will take for Canada to uphold its commitment to combatting climate change. The Paris Agreement was ratified earlier this month and is unprecedented amongst international agreements for how quickly it has come into force. This agreement allows each country to decide how it will tackle climate change and requires, as of 2020, regular reporting on progress. Countries of the world have officially embarked on a global race to implement ambitious climate policies that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the planetary scale. This process is not unlike the Olympic Games where countries get together to compare their strengths and performance. If Canada wants to be a medalist in 2020, domestic climate policies must rapidly be adopted to accelerate the low carbon transition. In this context, Sustainable Canada Dialogues   a network of 60+ scholars from across Canada   produced a progress report on the country s climate actions over the past year. We analyzed climate decisions made in Ottawa in 2016 in relationship to the 10 policy orientations that we proposed previously in our position paper entitled Acting on Climate Change: Solutions from Canadian Scholars . Canada took two important steps forward. First, the federal government will price carbon throughout the country starting in 2018. Second, the $120 billion infrastructure investment plan explicitly highlights support for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This investment plan raises hopes that Canada can make the transition to low carbon development, but its real impact depends on identifying and funding infrastructure projects that best contribute to desired low-carbon and sustainable outcomes. Despite this progress, the decision to approve the Pacific NorthWest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is a step backward, casting doubt on the willingness of the federal government to meaningfully tackle climate change. The impact assessment indicates that this LNG project would be one of the largest point source of emissions in Canada and would increase British Columbia s emissions by 8.5 per cent. Continued development of projects with high greenhouse gas emissions will compromise progress in other sectors. It will prevent Canada from meeting its emissions reduction target for 2030, and is incompatible with Canada s stated goal to help limit global temperature increases to 1.5oC. Research indeed estimates that, to maintain global temperature increase below 2oC, half of existing gas reserves and one third of existing oil ones must remain unused. Canadian climate policy must tackle the most difficult question: how to transition away from fossil fuels? We call for federal political leadership that steadily and strategically adopts innovative low-carbon tools to drive future economic growth. This requires engaging with a broad range of stakeholders from the oil and gas industry, unions, Indigenous peoples, environmental NGOs, the clean technology sector and academia to discuss how to reorient subsidies away from the fossil fuel industry, promote transitions to low-carbon energy, while ensuring that workers from the oil and gas industry can transition their skills to other sectors. Ambitious Canadian climate leadership is necessary more than ever in North America. Only by working together and building commitment across all sectors will Canada live up to the expectations it rose by joining the High Ambition Coalition in 2015. Despite positive steps, the federal government has been unable so far to develop a coherent climate action plan largely because of its inability to address fossil fuels coherently.
