What are my options? Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about admission to our graduate program in Clinical Psychology Q. I primarily want to be a Clinical Psychologist. What are the other local opportunities to develop the type of career that I want? A. There are many different graduate programs that allow one to have a career as a psychologist or therapist. Some local universities offer a Psy.D. in Psychology (e.g. psy.umontreal.ca/programmes- et- cours/cycles- superieurs/doctorat en- psychologie clinique/ ). This is a doctoral degree in Psychology that does not require the research component of a Ph.D. thesis. Other graduate programs include Counselling Psychology (e.g. www.mcgill.ca/edu ecp/), and Art, Drama or Music Therapy (e.g. creativeartstherapies.concordia.ca/ ). Different programs may or may not have the strict research pre- requisites and heavy research component that are required for an M.A./Ph.D. Program in Clinical Psychology. Q. What are my chances of being accepted into the graduate  Research and Clinical Training Option  in Psychology at Concordia? A. Although we receive hundreds of applications from highly qualified honours students, we are only able to accept 11 new clinical students each year. Students that do not have a conventional honours undergraduate degree in psychology or its equivalent, or who have not completed an empirical research thesis as part of their undergraduate studies, can sometimes be at a further disadvantage. Q. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist, but I don t have an undergraduate degree in Psychology. What are my options? A. Due to our accreditation from the CPA and APA, we require certain pre-requisite psychology course competencies prior to entrance into the graduate program. You can enrol in a university undergraduate psychology program and complete these courses   as listed in our honours degree equivalency checklist. If you already have a BA or BSc degree, you do not need to complete a second degree in psychology, merely the pre-requisite courses. Q. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but it isn t an honours degree. What are my options? A. This presents a little more of a problem. If you already have an undergraduate degree in psychology, you cannot enrol in a second undergraduate psychology degree program. You can enrol as an independent student in some cases, but many universities, including Concordia, restrict the higher level psychology courses to psychology majors. Thus, you may not have access to the courses you need when enrolled as an independent student. Some universities, including McGill, offer a special status student program to make up for any course deficiencies for graduate school ( www.psych.mcgill.ca/grad/program/application_admission.htm ). At the present time, Concordia does not have a qualifying program for this purpose. Q. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but my grades are below what is required (minimum GPA of 3.5/4.3). What are my options? A. Grades aren t the only factor taken into account when considering an applicant for graduate school. For example research experience is weighed very heavily. However, this particular program is very competitive and the odds of someone with a low GPA being accepted into the clinical program are very low. Some students feel that taking a few more courses and getting better grades will help. Usually a few courses will not have a great impact on the overall GPA and all courses are weighted equally during our admissions process. Q. I don t have an Honours Psychology degree, but I have lots of work experience in counselling and/or therapy. Can my work experience be considered for my application instead of university courses or research experience? A. Our graduate program is heavily based upon the research-practitioner model. It is assumed that counselling/therapy skills will be taught once in the program so they are not a pre-requisite for entry into the program. Thus, pre-requisite coursework and research experience are considered most important for our admissions process and prior counselling experience cannot replace those. Q. If I apply to the graduate Psychology Program (Research Option) and I am accepted to that program, can I later switch to the Research and Clinical Option? A. No. If a student is accepted into the graduate program,  Research Option  they are not eligible to later apply to the  Research and Clinical Training Option .

Take the test The free rapid-HIV testing is happening both days from 12 to 4 p.m. in Room 711, on the Sir George Williams Campus. It's sponsored in part by Clinical Projects Grant from the Ordre r gional des infirmi res et infirmiers de Montr al/Laval, as well the CSU Special Projects fund. The CSU, Queer Concordia , Health Services and the Concordia Undergraduate Psychology Association (CUPA) are collaborating to run the testing events. To choose from a variety of free condoms at the give-away, simply go to the Atrium of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) on the Sir George Williams Campus. You can always get free condoms at the weekly Healthy YOU at CU information table, or come by Health Services Condom Boutique where you can choose from a variety of condoms, \"3-for-$1\"!  The goal is to remind students that regular STI testing is a normal part of taking care of your health, just like going to the dentist,  says Gabriella Szabo, health promotion specialist with  Health Services .  And students get their results in 20 minutes, rather than 10 days.  Be informed and empowered December 1 is World Aids Day and a perfect occasion to have a clear-headed conversation about sexually transmitted infections (STIs). CATIE , a Canadian online source for information and resources about HIV and AIDS, is a good place to learn more about the history and contemporary reality of the disease. The Concordia University Community Lecture Series on HIV/AIDS has its fourth event on December 1 from 6:45 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the Museum of Fine Arts. London artist Conal McStravick will discuss the impact of the AIDS crisis on art and parallel queer activist movements at the event, entitled Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism, and the AIDS Crisis: Learning in a Public Medium. Consent is essential to practicing safer sex. Last February, the two-day student organized fair, called  Sexpress Yourself , helped propel the dialogue on campus about safe and consensual sex with similar events. At the time, Jennifer Drummond, coordinator of the Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC) explained:  We want to reach as many students as we can and make sure they know about our support services and activities,  she says.

I want to know what people are up to,  says Nisi Sinzinkayo, a Moncton, N.B., transplant. For her, Concordia s Department of Psychology was a natural fit. As Sinzinkayo says:  I see this as a way to understand people even more.  Department of Psychology student Nisi Sinzinkayo Before taking the plunge and moving to Montreal for her undergraduate studies, Sinzinkayo had developed a strong opinion of both Concordia and Montreal.  I visited the city and have friends who attended Concordia,  says Sinzinkayo.  I like how open-minded people are here. People don t judge you.  One hurdle for Sinzinkayo is the costs that come with studying.  Coming out of province, tuition is automatically more expensive,  says Sinzinkayo. Add to that, she notes that there are living expenses such as rent and public transit. Sinzinkayo received the Leonard and Bina Ellen Entrance Bursary her first year of study in 2014.  That was a great email to receive,  says Sinzinkayo, who entered the university as a teenager directly from high school.  I have siblings, so I think of all the things my parents help pay for. The bursary was welcome news for all of us,  she says. Sinzinkayo already has long-term career ambitions.   If I could continue going with psychology, that would be great,  says Sinzinkayo.  I would like to complete a PhD.   Psychology is a good foundational education. As a  plan B  I would want to go into marketing.  Sinzinkayo expects to finish her bachelor s degree by 2018. #CUgiving Read more inspiring stories like this one in Momentum, Concordia's Donor and Student Awards newsletter.

Concordia research associate Nuria de Zavalia explains how Daylight Saving Time affects our circadian rhythms, and how you can lessen the impact Posted on November 4, 2016 | By: J. Latimer  The extra hour of sleep sounds great, but when we change the time, there's an alteration of the circadian rhythms and that's when the problems start.  | Photo by Woodleywonderworks (Flickr CC) Is everyone ready to get an extra hour of sleep this weekend? At 2 a.m. this Sunday morning, November 6, we will return to standard time by moving our clocks back one hour. This change happens annually on the first Sunday in November   unless you live in most of Saskatchewan, Southampton Island in Nunavut or small pockets of Northwestern Ontario, Quebec or BC. These regions of Canada never opted into Daylight Saving Time (DST), although other cities and regions were using DST as early as 1918. Spring forward, fall back  The extra hour of sleep sounds great, but when we change the time, there's an alteration of the circadian rhythms and that's when the problems start,  says Nuria de Zavalia, a research associate who works with Shimon Amir , a psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia. It's like jet lag, she adds, explaining that alterations in the circadian system can affect alertness, mood, stress hormone levels, memory formation, cognitive performance, metabolism, cardiovascular system and, especially, depression.  Daylight Saving Time does not help people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder , for example,  says de Zavalia.  And research has shown that the Monday after the time change   especially in the spring, when we have one hour less sleep   there is an increase in car accidents, heart attacks and depressive episodes .  So, what can be done to lessen the effects of returning to standard time?  Start early,  says de Zavalia.  If you can change the clocks a few days early, in 10-minute increments instead of a full hour in one shot, it ll be easier on your system.

At least one in four Canadians will have an anxiety disorder in their lifetime. While effective therapies for these often-debilitating disorders exist, many sufferers find them very difficult to engage with or complete. This prompted researchers at Concordia to look for ways to make treatment easier to handle for those who need it most. In studies recently published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders and forthcoming in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Concordia psychology researchers Hannah Levy and Adam Radomsky show that the very behaviours people use to avoid anxiety could become part of an effective treatment, and that patients have a significant role to play in deciding when those behaviours are no longer necessary. Radomsky and Levy focus on safety behaviours   things people do to make themselves feel less anxious. Examples include wearing gloves when touching dirty objects, avoiding eye contact during stressful interactions, distracting yourself when doing something scary   any behaviour that increases feelings of safety in anxiety-provoking situations.  Traditionally, psychologists thought that fading out or eliminating these behaviours entirely should be the primary focus of the therapy used to combat anxiety disorders. But we found that changing those behaviours and giving patients greater agency is much more effective,  says Radomsky, professor in Concordia s Department of Psychology and senior author of the studies. He and Levy followed 157 study participants   ranging from people with low-level anxieties to those diagnosed OCD   as they adapted old habits with new ones that they could use to avoid anxiety during exposure therapy, in which the therapist exposes the patient to feared objects or situations without any danger. The researchers found that using new safety behaviours during exposure therapy was slightly more helpful to participants than their usual or typical safety behaviours. They also found that the most important aspect of reducing the use of safety behaviours in therapy is that the client or patient be the one who decides when they are ready to move forward without them.   This is different from the standard approach in which therapists encourage people to drop their safety behaviours at the outset of the therapy, which often leads people to drop out or refuse the treatment. Under the right conditions, safety behaviours have the potential to make the therapy more effective, and more acceptable,  explains Levy, who recently defended her PhD in psychology at Concordia and will graduate this summer. Radomsky, who also holds a Concordia University Research Chair in Anxiety and Related Disorders, says the results of the research could help therapists shape their approach to best help each person with whom they re working.  It s our hope that these findings will help to reduce the number of people who refuse or drop out of cognitive behavioural therapies and should result in more people getting the help that they need.

He has accepted a professorship in Universit  de Montr al s Faculty of Medicine, where he will be conducting research on exercise and brain health at the Montr al Heart Institute. Bherer will continue his association with Concordia as associate scientific director. Habib Benali | Photo by David Ward Stepping in as interim scientific director of the preventive health centre is  Habib Benali , a professor of electrical and computer engineering and PERFORM's associate scientific director of biomedical engineering. Graham Carr, Vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies, says Bherer has made truly exceptional contributions to Concordia.  He has really put his imprint on PERFORM as a centre for innovation and collaboration in the field of prevention and healthy lifestyle, which is one the most dynamic areas of health research and training.  The new opportunity he is pursuing speaks to the world-class quality of his personal research program  and to the respect that Concordia is earning as an important and unique contributor to the field of medical research in Montreal,  As the inaugural PERFORM chair and scientific director, Louis s vision, energy, appetite for collaboration and ambition for success have put the centre on the map. His tireless work has enabled us to recruit outstanding faculty of international quality, attract top-quality students and postdocs and emerge as an important new partner in the Quebec and Canadian landscape of health research.  I am proud of and grateful for everything that Louis has given to Concordia. He is a true leader. I know I am not alone in being sad at his decision to move over the mountain, but I am very eager to pursue new collaborations as he embarks on the next phase of his astonishing career.  For his part, Bherer is proud of what the PERFORM research team has been able to accomplish over the last four years.  We ve laid the foundation for our mission of advancing research, education and community engagement while offering unique opportunities for new discoveries in preventive health research,  he says.  With the support and guidance of the exceptional team of researchers, students and staff we have established, PERFORM will continue to blossom in the years to come.  Looking forward, Carr is extremely pleased that PERFORM will be in safe hands under the leadership of Habib Benali, given the scope of his international research and administrative portfolio, his extraordinary connections with the health research community in Montr al and his commitment to the institutional vision for PERFORM.  We are unbelievably fortunate that a person of Habib s calibre and experience is poised to accept the interim scientific director position,  says Carr.  As an engineer who also has deep connections in the Faculty of Arts and Science, he will continue to advance PERFORM s role in fostering interdisciplinary research and training collaborations between numerous departments and faculties, as well as with our many inter-institutional research networks.  Benali s research examines how multimodal imaging and computational modelling can be used to better understand which factors promote a healthy lifestyle. The internationally renowned scientist from Paris, who has received multiple distinctions and research awards, brings a wealth of leadership experience to the position. Prior to joining Concordia earlier this year, he served as co-director of the International Laboratory of Neuroimaging and Modelling (LlNeM), a collaboration of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (lNSERM), Universit  Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC, part of the Sorbonne Universities) and Universit  de Montr al. Benali was the head of the Laboratory of Functional Imaging (INSERM U678 unit, France) until 2013, and served as the deputy director of the 110-member Biomedical Imaging Laboratory U1146, INSERM   part of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and UPMC University   until 2015. He looks forward to his new leadership role at Concordia. \"My goal is to develop strong relationships with other research teams generating and fostering preventive health research, and research engineering teams, in particular, on the regional, national and international scene,  he says.  I hope to provide the scientific direction to make the PERFORM Centre a world leader in research, education and community involvement for better health.  Carr says that the leadership team at the centre, which also includes Jean-Paul Soucy, PERFORM associate director of bio-imaging and a professor at McGill University, an outstanding professional staff, and a strong team of department chairs and research scientists who help to execute the vision for PERFORM, will continue to have Concordia s full support as they work to increase the visibility and impact of preventive and healthy lifestyle research.

On June 17 and 18, alumni of the Centre will return to Concordia for A Night at the Oscar, a monumental retrospective variety show at the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall. How it all began The CAHD was officially created in 1996, but the catalyst for it occurred in 1993 when Lenore Vosberg, a social worker at the West Montreal Readaptation Centre, approached Concordia s Stephen Snow , then a professor of theatre and currently an associate professor of drama therapy and chair of the Department of Creative Arts Therapies, about staging a play with her clients.  It was magical, it just came together. People were astounded. That first play founded a 20-year tradition for the Centre,  says Snow, who recently became the first recipient of the Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health.* Every second year, the CAHD accepts 20 people with developmental disabilities referred by social workers at readaptation centres and CLSCs. Students come Mondays and Fridays for two years. At the end of their second year, they host a big public outreach event, usually a play. The group comes back on Wednesdays for a third and final year   the denouement, if you will. Ethnodramas and 100 original songs  The theme of our show is 'We Can',  says Lenore Vosberg, the CAHD executive director.  The song 'I Can' was from And Alice Dreams ... and we're expanding it to be 'We Can,' which will be our closing number. We have a core group of singers and behind them there will be everybody else, around 65 people, doing sign language for the lyrics.  Part of A Night at the Oscar will be dedicated to honouring the music of Shelley Snow, who has composed more than 100 original songs during her time as the Centre's music therapist. The CAHD has been at the forefront of using ethnodramas   plays based on the performers' lived experiences   as therapy. So far three ethnodramas have been produced, all to tremendous acclaim.   Stephen Goulet performed in 2012's  Our World: A Musical Ethnodrama  and really enjoyed his experience.  Some days were tough. But with all the bad stuff put aside, I loved every minute of it.  Goulet will also be performing in A Night at the Oscar. They always want me to come back, and I never say no.   Taking everyone for who they are  Choreographing the dance numbers for the retrospective is Gelymar Sanchez, a professional dancer and Concordia psychology student. She first began as a volunteer at the Centre in January 2015,  teaching yoga . Sanchez is working on six dance acts for the show, reshaping original choreography for some and creating others from scratch, each movement designed to suit the dancer.  It's about taking everyone for who they are and for their abilities, rather than their disabilities,  she says.  They keep on surprising me and renewing my vision of dance. Some of the participants are so talented, I feel they are five times better than the best professional dancers I've worked with before. They really blow my mind.  From the stage to the big screen The Centre's story is one that has resounded strongly with people far and wide. CBC made a documentary in 2000 about the CAHD play And Alice Dreams... called Finding Wonderland. In 2011, EyeSteelFilm released the documentary The Frog Princes , about the play The Frog & the Princess .  When CBC came, they were going to come for one day. They got so fascinated by the process, they stayed for two weeks,  says Snow. Because the cast for this year's play is comprised of past participants, the 2014-16 group's public outreach event is an art installation, part of which will be on display in the foyer of the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall during the performance nights. Art pieces will be available for sale. Crafts made by the  participants will also be available for purchase.

Long afternoons practising scales. All that time you spent in piano lessons and dance classes as a youngster may have seemed like a pain, but new research now confirms what your parents claimed: it s good for mind and body. In fact, a recent study published in NeuroImage by a team* of researchers from the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research, proves that dance and music training have even stronger effects on the brain than previously understood   but in markedly different ways. The researchers used high-tech imaging techniques to compare the effects of dance and music training on the white matter structure of experts in these two disciplines. They then examined the relationship between training-induced brain changes and dance and music abilities.  We found that dancers and musicians differed in many white matter regions, including sensory and motor pathways, both at the primary and higher cognitive levels of processing,  says Chiara Giacosa, PhD candidate in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and the study s lead author. In particular, dancers showed broader connections of fibre bundles linking the sensory and motor brain regions themselves, as well as broader fibre bundles connecting the brain s two hemispheres   in the regions that process sensory and motor information. In contrast, musicians had stronger and more coherent fibre bundles in those same pathways.  This suggests that dance and music training affect the brain in opposite directions, increasing global connectivity and crossing of fibres in dance training, and strengthening specific pathways in music training,  Giacosa explains.  Indeed, while dancers train their whole body, which has a broader representation in the neural cortex, musicians focus their training on some specific body parts, such as hands, fingers or the mouth, which have a smaller cortical representation in the brain.   This work has major potential  Interestingly, dancers and musicians differed more between each other than in comparison to the group of control subjects who had no extensive formal training in either field. According to Giacosa, this can happen because a range of uncontrolled variables influenced the control subjects in different ways, making them more similar to one group or the other.  Contrary to that, our samples of dancers and musicians were specifically selected to be pure groups of experts, which makes it easier to differentiate between them.  Virginia Penhune , professor in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and chair of its Department of Psychology , is the study s senior author. She notes that this research deepens the current knowledge about how regions of the brain are connected in networks, and how these structural networks change with training.  This work has major potential for being applied to the fields of education and rehabilitation,  Penhune says.  Understanding how dance and music training differently affect brain networks will allow us to selectively use them to enhance their functioning or compensate for difficulties and diseases that involve those specific brain networks.  Some studies have already shown how music training at a young age can improve various cognitive skills, but dance has yet to be used in a similar way.  Recent research has started to show some improvements with dance and music therapy in patients affected by Parkinson s disease and children with autism respectively, but much more can be done with these and other diseases,  says Penhune. *Partners in research: The co-authors of this study   Chiara Giacosa, Falisha J.

New Concordia research published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology shows that may be thanks to the hormones that trigger the menstrual cycle.  Women have sometimes reported to doctors that their memory works differently depending on which phase of the menstrual cycle they are in  even during and following pregnancy, or following menopause. This has led scientists to wonder whether estrogen and progesterone could affect memory and problem solving,  says psychology professor Wayne Brake , who co-authored the study.  Our research shows that, rather than impairing memory in general, estrogen and progesterone may instead cause the brain to favour one memory system or strategy over another.    Hormones influence problem-solving For the study, researchers tested 45 women who had regular menstrual cycles. First, participants responded to a  hormonal profile  questionnaire that gathered detailed information on their periods, past pregnancies, contraceptive and synthetic hormone intake history and general life habits. The participants were then given a verbal memory task, such as remembering a list of words, as well as a virtual navigation task, such as finding their way through a maze in a video game, that could be solved in several ways. At the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed on how they solved the tasks from beginning to end. Results were clear: women who were ovulating performed better on the verbal memory task. On the other hand, women tested in their pre-menstrual phase were better at solving spatial navigation tasks. That proves that women tend to use different strategies to solve tasks   such as navigating a maze or remembering a list of words   depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle. Essentially, the study shows that the hormonal changes women experience throughout their cycles have a broader impact than previously believed, and have significant effects on how women approach and solve problems.  This is important scientifically. We and others have previously shown that the levels of estrogen and progesterone in rodents influence different brain regions, affecting various memory systems involved in task-solving,  says Brake.  For example, when estrogen levels are high, female rats will use one type of memory system or strategy versus another to solve a maze. This is the first study to show that this is also true for women, who solve tasks in different ways based on their hormones  'Research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain' For recent PhD graduate Dema Hussain, the study s lead author, these results point to an ongoing bias in scientific research.  Traditionally, researchers and scientists have relied on using male participants   and male rats   in studies to develop drugs and treatments for the general population. But we now know that women respond differently than men,  she says.  I hope that this study emphasizes that more research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain, and that efforts must be made to tailor future research to improve our understanding of the effects of female sex hormones on cognition and memory.

In 2015 16, topics included gene editing and CRISPR technology , storytelling in research and the future of diversity . The series also spawned a podcast , which is ongoing.  Last year really exceeded our expectations,  says Andr  Roy , dean of FAS.  So, naturally, we want to set the bar even higher.  On Thursday, October 20, the first Beyond Disciplines event of the season,   Come to your senses: Sensescapes in research and in life ,  invites the audience to experience a variety of sensory-themed presentations. Held in collaboration with Concordia s Centre for Sensory Studies, the evening will be hosted by centre co-director David Howes . According to Roy, this year s series won t follow the traditional format of a panel discussion and Q&A.  We really wanted to mix things up and start with something completely different.  Claudine Gauthier is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and one of the upcoming featured speakers. For her, the experience is a rare opportunity to exchange on a topic of research with people from very different fields, and share different perspectives with the public. Gauthier s presentation will discuss how the brain \"sees\" images and how this changes with age.  I will show Magnetic Resonance Imaging pictures of the brain in action during a task, and how we can learn about changes in brain function and aging from these images,  she explains.  Thinking outside the box  Fellow presenter Owen Chapman , associate professor in Communication Studies , will offer an audiovisual experience based on work developed in the Mobile Media Lab that he co-directs.  I will DJ/VJ a short set featuring remixing of both local and distant audio field recordings through an immersive 3D virtual soundscape platform,  says Chapman.  I hope to prompt users to think about the causes and effects of the sounds of one's everyday life.  Another first for Beyond Disciplines this year? Inviting people from outside FAS. Featured panellists in the  Come to your senses  event include Cynthia Hammond , Shauna Janssen and Rhona Richman Kenneally , all from the Faculty of Fine Arts .  I have been investigating the intersections between taste as a sense experience and taste as sanctioned design or style,  explains Richman Kenneally, a professor in the Department of Design and Computation Arts and a fellow in the School of Irish Studies .  I am really looking forward to participating in this event, since my academic training as well as my ongoing research are fundamentally grounded in transdisciplinarity across design and the humanities.  Roy says the series plans to continue thinking outside the box, and promises more surprises as the season unfolds.  We have always said we wanted to explore different forms and formats. As great as last year was, I am confident this one will be even better.

Concordia researchers explain how fancy glassware and the sight of a liquor store can facilitate alcohol addiction Posted on May 25, 2016 | Version fran aise  Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues.  | Photo by Photholic (Flickr CC) Humans aren t much different from other animals. Just like Pavlov s dogs , we can become conditioned to associate environmental cues with rewards. Innocent enough when the sight of your sneakers makes you want to go for a run, but not necessarily so when the sight of the liquor store prompts you to want a drink. Indeed, Pavlovian cues that predict alcohol can lead us toward addiction. And sometimes those cues can become desirable in and of themselves, as shown in a new study by Concordia researchers, published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience .  Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues,  says Nadia Chaudhri , the study s lead author and professor in the Department of Psychology .  Conditioned reactions to those cues can trigger behaviours that result in drinking, like turning into the SAQ or reaching for a beer.  The results of the study suggest that cues that predict alcohol can become highly desirable; therefore, people may keep drinking because of the pleasure derived from our interactions with them. According to this research, drinkers wishing to make a change in their habits shouldn t just focus on the booze itself, but on all the factors that surround alcohol consumption.  Many people have specialized glassware for different kinds of drinks, and strong preferences for what they drink,  Chaudhri explains.  These preferences could be driven by the sensory properties of alcohol, like its taste, smell and how it looks. It is important for people to realize that drinking alcohol is a complex behaviour, and in addition to what alcohol does to our brains, it also plays a role in regulating our behaviours.  For the study, Chaudhri and her co-authors, former Concordia student Chandra Srey and postdoctoral researcher Jean-Marie Maddux , worked with 25 lab rats who were conditioned to associated a specific cue with the presence of ethanol   the main kind of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks. The researchers paired a visual cue with the ethanol so that rats would come to expect alcohol every time they saw that cue. Eventually, when the cue was presented, rats approached the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. But after a time they stopped performing this behaviour and instead began approaching and interacting with the cue. This happened even though the rats gained nothing by playing with the cue, and would actually have been better served by approaching the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. The researchers also noted that the rats would work to earn presentations of a cue that was previously paired with alcohol, even when alcohol was not dispensed along with that cue. These results suggest that a cue that predicts alcohol can become highly desireable. So how can rat behaviour help explain human addiction?  Lots of our behaviours are governed by fundamental learning mechanisms that are also present in other animal species,  says Chaudhri.  By modelling these behaviours in rats we can better understand the factors that control how these behaviours are acquired and maintained in humans.  She explains that we can use animal models to figure out ways to minimize unwanted behaviours like responding to cues that predict alcohol.  This knowledge can then be brought back to the clinic, where we can test similar strategies in humans,  says Chaudhri.  Rat models can also be used to inform us of the brain mechanisms that are important for behaviour. These basic science studies provide a critical foundation for the development of treatments for disorders like alcohol abuse and addiction.  Chaudhri will soon present the results of this and other related studies at the upcoming Society for Quantitative Analyses of Behavior annual symposium taking place May 27 to 28 in Chicago.

Profiles of Clinical Faculty LUCIE BONNEVILLE My clinical interests are in several areas such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety and psychotic symptoms.  My orientation is eclectic.  In general, I use techniques from the models of Humanistic, Psychodynamic, Existential and Cognitive therapies in short and long term psychotherapy with adults and late adolescence. SAM BURSTEIN, Clinical Psychologist at the Montreal Children s Hospital and in private practice.  My clinical experience lies mainly in the area of working with children and their families, wherein the presenting concern is child-related. Conceptualization and intervention directed at the family level stem from the belief that the family system is usually the most relevant and powerful in an individual's life.  Although a family system approach does not preclude working with an individual child/adolescent, it does assume that change in the client will have an important impact on other family members. Within the area of individual work, my bias is toward a cognitive-behavioral approach.  MARK ELLENBOGEN, Director of Practica and Chair of CUPIP,  CRDH  Member,  Research Interests My therapeutic orientation is predominantly based on the principles of cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy. My clinical approach is to use empirically supported treatments that are tailored to fit the needs of individual clients.  My clinical interests include diagnostic assessment and individual psychotherapy, in adult and adolescent populations with major affective disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and eating disorders. DINA GIANNOPOULOS,  APC  Administrative Director My clinical interests are in the areas of depression and anxiety disorders.  I supervise students who are interested in conducting cognitive-behaviour therapy with adults.  Emphasis is placed on empirically validated cognitive-behaviour therapy techniques.  The client-therapist relationship is also examined in supervision. JENNIFER MCGRATH,  Research Interests My therapeutic orientation is fundamentally guided by cognitive-behavioral principles and the use of empirically supported treatments while incorporating components of other orientations tailored to fit the needs of individual clients.  My clinical interests largely span the area of child health psychology to include Childhood Behavior Disorders, Developmental Disorders, Behavioral Medicine (Diabetes, Oncology/Cancer, Headache, Enuresis, Feeding/Eating Problems, Cardiovascular Disease, Sleep Disorders, Anxiety, Depression, Smoking Cessation, Medical Regimen Adherence, Coping with Chronic Illness, Coping with Stress), Psychoeducational Assessments, and Psychiatric Triage.  Students on my supervision team have the opportunity to learn how to conduct comprehensive psychoeducational assessments of children and adolescents as well as lead group therapy for parents and children with health related issues (e.g., sleep problems, smoking cessation, stress management). SYDNEY MILLER,  Research Interests I have two main areas of clinical interest which would be relevant for the subject populations likely to be seen at the clinic. In general, my therapeutic orientation in both these areas is cognitive behavioral. One area of interest is adult psychopathology involving a variety of problems including the anxiety disorders (e.g. agoraphobia, panic, social phobia, simple phobia), depression, couples with marital problems, assertiveness issues, and social skills training. Another area of interest is in adult health psychology. This involves the treatment of physical illness and related psychological problems. The type of clients who might be seen include individuals with weight problems, headaches, high blood pressure, back pain and insomnia. ROISIN O'CONNOR  Research Interests My clinical interests include the assessment and treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders as the single presenting concern for adolescents and adults, or when co-morbid with substance use (i.e., alcohol use) concerns/disorders.  I am also interested in the assessment and treatment of pathological gambling.  I approach my clinical work as a scientist-practitioner. Accordingly, I draw on cognitive-behavioural therapy and other empirically supported treatments. I emphasize the use of theory-grounded case conceptualizations, hypothesis testing, and on-going data collection throughout treatment.  Some of the intervention strategies I use are skills training, cue exposure, response prevention, behavioural experiments, and cognitive reevaluations.  As well, I support the use of motivational interviewing techniques. VIRGINIA PENHUNE,  CRDH  Member  Research Interests The practicum in Neuropsychology is designed to teach students the fundamentals of neuropsychological assessment and to prepare them for external practica and internships in Neuropsychology or in domains that require familiarity with cognitive and neuropsychological assessment.  The practicum will include a didactic and training period, covering basic theoretical issues in Neuropsychology as well as, test administration and scoring, clinical interview and report writing, as well as review of common medical tests relevant for neurological populations (i.e., MRI, CT, EEG).  During this time, students will practice tests with other students and with at least one normal volunteer.  One practice testing session will be videotaped and reviewed with the supervisor. After satisfactorily completing the practice testing, students will go on to test 2-3 consecutive clinical patients over course of the year.  This will include reviewing the neuropsychological and neurological literature relevant to the particular disorder, putting together an appropriate battery of tests for each patient, administering the tests and writing a complete neuropsychological test report.

ADAM RADOMSKY  Research Interests My main areas of clinical interest are the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders and related problems in adults. I use a cognitive-behavioural approach and support the use of this and other empirically validated treatments identified by the Canadian and American Psychological Associations. The practicum emphasizes the application of cognitive-behavioural models and methods, including: the development of a collaborative relationship, self-monitoring, exposure (both imaginal and in vivo), response prevention, relaxation techniques, behavioural experiments, hypothesis testing, cognitive/belief investigations, habit reversal, evaluation of treatment gains and relapse prevention. These and other strategies will be applied to a variety of anxiety disorders and related problems.  ANDREW RYDER  Research Interests My therapeutic orientation is predominantly cognitive-behavioural, influenced by the existential perspective on the person and the ultimate goals of therapy, and by the interpersonal perspective at the level of moment-to-moment interactions between therapist and client. As a scientist-practitioner, I take an evidence-based approach, meaning that specific interventions are informed both by the published literature and by evidence obtained over the course of a specific case (e.g., assessments, mood diaries, observation). My clinical interests are assessment and treatment of anxiety, depression, and personality/interpersonal problems. LISA SERBIN, Director of Clinical Training, Member of  CRDH ,  Research Interests My research and clinical interests focus on developmental psychopathology and children's health. Specifically, I am interested in disorders of childhood, and in the environmental and social contexts in which children's development takes place. My clinical supervision focuses on the assessment and treatment of children referred for learning, emotional, social and behavioral problems. The focus is on the child, the family, and the environment (including daycare, school, and home settings). Assessment and treatment typically focus on the development of age-appropriate social and cognitive skills, as well as on emotional, behavioral and family problems, with treatment modality determined by the needs of the case. In recent years children have been seen under my supervision for problems including learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, behavior and attentional disorders, conduct disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. Students under my direction have learned to use cognitive-behavioral therapy, play therapy, crisis management, and family therapy approaches, and to integrate these diverse theoretical models in developing effective strategies for intervention. DALE STACK,  CRDH  Member,  Research Interests My clinical experience is in the area of assessment and treatment of difficulties that occur in children (and their families).   My particular focus is working with very young children (preschoolers) and their families.   This area encompasses a range of problems including (but not limited to) developmental delays, expressive and/or receptive language delays, pervasive developmental disorders, behavior problems, sensory and physical disabilities, adjustment difficulties, child management and parenting, and family issues.   My general approach is cognitive-behavioral.   I underscore the importance of comprehensive assessment and I utilize alternative assessment procedures when valuable (e.g., non-verbal, non-compliant, etc.,).   Given the age range of the children, my clinical work involves direct contact with the child and his/her parent(s)/caregivers (and family).

I want to know what people are up to,  says Nisi Sinzinkayo, a Moncton, N.B., transplant. For her, Concordia s Department of Psychology was a natural fit. As Sinzinkayo says:  I see this as a way to understand people even more.  Department of Psychology student Nisi Sinzinkayo Before taking the plunge and moving to Montreal for her undergraduate studies, Sinzinkayo had developed a strong opinion of both Concordia and Montreal.  I visited the city and have friends who attended Concordia,  says Sinzinkayo.  I like how open-minded people are here. People don t judge you.  One hurdle for Sinzinkayo is the costs that come with studying.  Coming out of province, tuition is automatically more expensive,  says Sinzinkayo. Add to that, she notes that there are living expenses such as rent and public transit. Sinzinkayo received the Leonard and Bina Ellen Entrance Bursary her first year of study in 2014.  That was a great email to receive,  says Sinzinkayo, who entered the university as a teenager directly from high school.  I have siblings, so I think of all the things my parents help pay for. The bursary was welcome news for all of us,  she says. Sinzinkayo already has long-term career ambitions.   If I could continue going with psychology, that would be great,  says Sinzinkayo.  I would like to complete a PhD.   Psychology is a good foundational education. As a  plan B  I would want to go into marketing.  Sinzinkayo expects to finish her bachelor s degree by 2018. #CUgiving Read more inspiring stories like this one in Momentum, Concordia's Donor and Student Awards newsletter.

For example, Early Childhood Development Service; Child Psychiatry Day/Evening Hospital; Child and Adolescent (OPD); Youth Service (OPD: age 16-20); Adult Day Treatment; Adult In-Patient; Cognitive Behaviour Therapy; Couple and Family Therapy; Adult Rehabilitation Service (OPD); Neuropsychology. A range of theoretical orientations are available including Cognitive-Behavioural, Family Systems, and Psychodynamic. The Montreal General Hospital The Psychological Services places equal value on individual and group therapy modalities. Trainees are assigned to in-patients, out-patients and emergency room rotations. Equal time is given to Psychological Assessments and Therapeutic intervention activities. Trainees attend seminars and present at academic events. The orientation is Psychoanalytic/Psychodynamic. St. Mary's Hospital St. Mary's is a general hospital with a psychology service which is principally affiliated with the Department of Psychiatry. The center s patient population is exclusively adult. The great majority of patients are referred from the outpatient psychiatric department or from family medicine. Trainees may conduct individual therapy or psychometric assessments to evaluate intellectual, memory, and perceptual-motor functions or to clarify diagnostic questions. The theoretical orientation of the center s staff varies considerably, with some having a psychodynamic approach and others being more cognitive-behavioural or humanistic.

Take the test The free rapid-HIV testing is happening both days from 12 to 4 p.m. in Room 711, on the Sir George Williams Campus. It's sponsored in part by Clinical Projects Grant from the Ordre r gional des infirmi res et infirmiers de Montr al/Laval, as well the CSU Special Projects fund. The CSU, Queer Concordia , Health Services and the Concordia Undergraduate Psychology Association (CUPA) are collaborating to run the testing events. To choose from a variety of free condoms at the give-away, simply go to the Atrium of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) on the Sir George Williams Campus. You can always get free condoms at the weekly Healthy YOU at CU information table, or come by Health Services Condom Boutique where you can choose from a variety of condoms, \"3-for-$1\"!  The goal is to remind students that regular STI testing is a normal part of taking care of your health, just like going to the dentist,  says Gabriella Szabo, health promotion specialist with  Health Services .

The Concordia University Community Lecture Series on HIV/AIDS has its fourth event on December 1 from 6:45 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the Museum of Fine Arts. London artist Conal McStravick will discuss the impact of the AIDS crisis on art and parallel queer activist movements at the event, entitled Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism, and the AIDS Crisis: Learning in a Public Medium. Consent is essential to practicing safer sex. Last February, the two-day student organized fair, called  Sexpress Yourself , helped propel the dialogue on campus about safe and consensual sex with similar events. At the time, Jennifer Drummond, coordinator of the Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC) explained:  We want to reach as many students as we can and make sure they know about our support services and activities,  she says.  Outreach activities like this are also great opportunities to start important conversations and provide information about consent, bystander intervention and preventing sexual violence.

This change happens annually on the first Sunday in November   unless you live in most of Saskatchewan, Southampton Island in Nunavut or small pockets of Northwestern Ontario, Quebec or BC.

It's like jet lag, she adds, explaining that alterations in the circadian system can affect alertness, mood, stress hormone levels, memory formation, cognitive performance, metabolism, cardiovascular system and, especially, depression.  Daylight Saving Time does not help people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder , for example,  says de Zavalia.  And research has shown that the Monday after the time change   especially in the spring, when we have one hour less sleep   there is an increase in car accidents, heart attacks and depressive episodes .  So, what can be done to lessen the effects of returning to standard time?  Start early,  says de Zavalia.

At what age can children explain people s behaviours as being guided by their mental states? Who do toddlers trust to teach them new things   and why? These questions, and others like it, have been the focus of Diane Poulin-Dubois  s research for the last 31 years at Concordia. The psychology professor from the Faculty of Arts and Science leads the Cognitive and Language Development Lab . On October 18, Poulin-Dubois is being honoured with a career award   the Prix Acfas Th r se Gouin-D carie for social science. The Association francophone pour le savoir (Acfas) hosts the largest multidisciplinary gatherings of research and knowledge in the French-speaking world.  Professor Diane Poulin-Dubois s groundbreaking scholarship in early cognitive and language development is widely esteemed by peers and practitioners,  says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies at Concordia.  We are delighted to see her receive such prestigious recognition from Acfas for the impact she has made within and beyond academe, nationally and internationally.  This isn t the first time that Acfas has recognized Poulin-Dubois s contributions. In 1996, she won the Prix du meilleur article de vulgarisation scientifique de l ACFAS (faculty award). She was also on the organizing committee when Concordia hosted the 2014 Acfas conference ,  Research: Zones of Creativity and Convergence,   welcoming 5,100 scholars and offering 173 colloquia. Previous Acfas winners from the Concordia community include Michel Laroche , John Molson School of Business marketing professor, Andr  Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, Sherry Simon , French professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science, Marguerite Mendell , professor and graduate program director for the School of Community and Public Affairs, and Fran ois-Marc Gagnon , founding director of the Gail and Stephen A. Jarislowsky Institute for Studies in Canadian Art. A mentor feels  resurrected   Winning this award has a special sentimental value for me because it was recently renamed after my mentor, Th r se Gouin-D carie,  says Poulin-Dubois.  She is now retired but we talk frequently. She joked that my win has been like a resurrection for her.  This career award has also been gratifying for Poulin-Dubois, who is donating a portion of her $5,000 Acfas prize money to La Fondation du Dr. Julien which provides support to underprivileged children.  We work hard and this is recognition for what we do.  Just last year, her team published a study that proves that toddlers who learned more doublets (for example,  dog/chien ) over a seven-month period were ahead of the monolingual toddlers in executive function. This relates to skills such as planning, inhibition control and self-regulation. Her other recent work is in a relatively new field of social cognition called  trust,  which is the study of how children detect who to believe when acquiring new information.  We already know that preschoolers are more likely to learn from individuals with a history of making accurate claims over individuals who have been inaccurate or ignorant,  says Poulin-Dubois.  My particular contribution and insight is determining the origin of this ability. Which characteristics of the model are they sensitive to? Then you can speculate how our species has evolved differently or similarly to others.  Praise from the department William Bukowski , psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Centre for Research in Human Development , is thrilled that Acfas is recognizing Poulin-Dubois.  Diane has been at the forefront of understanding how the concepts that were popular in a Piagetian perspective can now be applied to other domains of functioning, such as bilingualism,  he says.   She is remarkable in her capacity to develop rigorous and very creative laboratory tests.  Bukowski also points to Poulin-Dubois s success as a supervisor.

Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, October 7. The recognition comes at the perfect time: five days after 50.2 per cent of voters rejected  a peace agreement with FARC, the oldest and biggest guerrilla group in the world. Today, as a graduate student at Concordia, I can think over what this means for me, for my country and for my academic career. I grew up in an urban context, distant from the day-to-day armed conflict. However, as is true for all Colombians, I grew up knowing that my country was one of the most violent places in the world. That motivated me to conduct research oriented toward informing peace education. When applying to the PhD in Psychology Program at Concordia, I included in my statement of purpose an explanation about how this would be  a secure step toward contributing to knowledge about the healthy development of children in order to meliorate the reality of Colombia and other countries.  I had the fortune to be accepted into the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory directed by William Bukowski , who has a deep knowledge of Colombian culture and has conducted research there over the last decade. This allowed me to maintain contact with my country, as did the Concordia Graduate Student Mobility Award that I got in 2015. That award allowed me to conduct a summer practice in Colombia, and to contribute to the production of a national report on students  results on citizenship abilities and a document on peace education directed to parents. I have to confess that despite all my purpose as a researcher in training, I was skeptical about seeing the end of the war in Colombia before I died. My hopelessness diminished when it was announced that the government and FARC would sign an agreement of peace, but increased again when I saw that not only had Colombians chosen to decline the referendum but also that 63 per cent of Colombians did not take part in the democratic process.   On Friday morning, thanks to an email from Dr. Bukowski, I found out that Santos was awarded the Nobel Prize, and optimism came back to me. As a supporter of the current agreement, I think that this prize represents pressure on the actors to find a prompt solution. The government, the opposition and FARC leaders will have to find a way to renegotiate the aspects that still need to be revised. The prize committee in Oslo was clear that this recognition is a tool to support Santos and his team in their intention to end a war that has been going on for 50 years. I have to say that on the negative side, Colombians have a culture  of the moment.  We glorify and celebrate while we forget the actual challenges we have to face. The main challenge is to change the minds of thousands of my compatriots who did not treat the peace discussion as a serious topic. I do not mean the people who voted either yes or no in the referendum   I am referring to those who did not participate. But in the face of a deeply divided country, this news brings us hope again.

In order to graduate, you are required to complete a specific number of Psychology credits and outside electives. Outside electives are courses offered in other programs outside of Psychology. You also must ensure you have completed any missing profile courses. To check your progress in our program, and track to make sure you are going to be able to graduate, use the program check sheets here: https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/students/undergraduate/monitoring-academic-progress.html If you are still uncertain after having completed the program check sheet, you can make an appointment to see an academic advisor. Always bring the completed checklist with you when seeing an academic advisor When will I finish my degree? This depends on your degree, the number of credits you need to graduate (90, 108, 120), the number of credits taken per semester, and if you also take summer courses. For example, if you are a full-time student taking 12 credits per semester, you can complete 90 credits in 4 years. If you take 15 credits per semester, it will take you three years to complete 90 credits. How many credits do I need to do per semester? To be a full-time student in Quebec, you must take a minimum of 12 credits per semester (usually 4 courses). The maximum load is 15 credits per semester (usually 5 courses). If you are worried about the workload that university courses require, we recommend you start out with 12 credits (i.e., 4 courses) in the first semester. If you can handle the workload, then go to 15 credits in subsequent semesters. If you are thinking of applying to Medicine, Law, or Graduate Degrees, then please check with the schools you plan to apply to for the degree requirements (some schools expect you to take a 15-credit to demonstrate that you can handle the workload). Should I take 4-5 Psychology Courses per semester? Psychology courses tend to demand more work from the student than other general elective courses. This is especially the case for courses that have a laboratory component (i.e., PSYC310, PSYC315, PSYC311, PSYC316). While it is possible to take a full Psychology course load per semester, it is not recommended. Instead, taking 2-3 psychology courses, in addition to 1-2 general electives is recommended. For the summer semester, how many courses should I take? Given the shorter more compact nature of the summer courses, we recommend taking no more than 6 credits (i.e., two courses) per summer term. Students wishing to receive financial aid during the summer are required to undertake 12 credits during the two summer terms. Should I drop a course? Students will sometimes think they should stay in a course even though they are doing poorly, as they have heard that a DISC looks bad on their transcript. It is ok to have a DISC on your transcript   this happens from time to time as students like the initial idea of a course, but find it different when taking it.  Also, as DISC is better than receiving an F for a course, as a poor grade affects your GPA (a DISC does not count towards your GPA). However, try to not make a habit of having too many DISCs. Do I need to meet with an advisor to repeat a course? Students can repeat a course at any point, without making an advising appointment. The exception is if you are trying to repeat a course which is a prerequisite for another course you are or have taken. Students should think of the following before repeating a course: 1)  While re-taking a course can improve your GPA this will only happen if you do better than you did the first time. If you end up with a lower grade in the re-take, then this will lower your GPA. The last taken grade is what counts towards the GPA. 2)  The earlier grade will remain on your transcript, and will not disappear. 3)  How have things changes since the first time you took the course? Have you improved your work load or study habits to give yourself a better opportunity for improving your grade? How many courses / what grades do I need to raise my GPA? This is a common question from students that are either attempting to graduate, are thinking of applying to graduate school, or are in academic jeopardy (e.g., conditional standing, failed standing) the best way to answer this question is to try out different course and grade scenarios to see how these may impact your GPA. We have made available a simple excel spreadsheet for this purpose (download link here).   QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO SPECIALIZATION STUDENTS WHO WANT TO TAKE THE OPTIONAL RESEARCH EXPERIENCE COURSE (PSYC 485) When do I take the required PSYC311 and PSYC316 courses? You must complete these two courses BEFORE you can get permission to register for PSYC 485. You will not be able to do PSYC 311 or PSYC 316 concurrently with PSYC 485. Keep in mind that PSYC 485 is a full year course, so PSYC 311 and PSYC 316 must be completed the year prior (usually in your second year). Also be aware that neither of these courses is offered during the summer. It is best to complete PSYC 316 and PSYC 311 (in that sequence) in separate semesters, as they both carry a heavy workload. When do I take PSYC 485? PSYC 485 is an optional course for students in the specialization program who wish to have the opportunity to conduct research. You would apply to take this course in the summer before your final year after you have received your grades from the winter term. You must have a minumim GPA of 3.0, and a thesis supervisor to be admitted. A completed application form and a 'supervisor-student-contract' (both available on the department website in the FORMS section) must be submitted with your application. How do I find a thesis supervisor? It is your responsibility to contact faculty members, and ask if they would be willing to act as your thesis supervisor. Not all faculty members take on a student each year and those that do take on a limited number. Prior to contacting a faculty member, students should consult the faculty profiles on the department website to find a research area that interests them. Be aware that there are a limited number of spots so register early! QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO HONOURS. When do I take the required PSYC311 and PSYC316 courses? You must complete these two courses BEFORE you can get permission to register for PSYC 495. You will not be able to do PSYC 311 or PSYC 316 concurrently with PSYC 495. Keep in mind that PSYC 495 is a full year course, so PSYC 311 and PSYC 316 must be completed the year prior (usually in your second year). Also be aware that neither of these courses is offered during the summer. It is best to complete PSYC 316 and PSYC 311 (in that sequence) in separate semesters, as they both carry a heavy workload. When do I take PSYC 490, 491, and 495? The Honours Seminars (PSYC 490, 491) and Honours Thesis Seminar (PSYC495) are taken in the final year of the honours program. To be able to register for these classes, you must have completed PSYC 311 and get permission from the department, which will be given once you have a confirmed thesis supervisor. You would take these courses in your final year provided your grades warrant your completing the honours program (have and maintain a minimum 3.5 cumulative GPA in PSYC courses, and 3.3 in all others). How do I find a thesis supervisor? It is your responsibility to contact faculty members, and ask if they would be willing to act as your thesis supervisor. Not all faculty members take on a student each year and those that do take on a limited number. Prior to contacting a faculty member, students should consult the faculty profiles on the department website to find a research area that interests them.  How do I secure a place in PSYC 491, 492, and 495? The honours advisor will open a place for you in a particular section after you let the advisor know, by email, which faculty member has agreed to be your research thesis supervisor, and the thesis supervisor confirms by email that you are accepted into the laboratory. If you are an Honours student, you do not have to complete the 'supervisor-student-contract' at this point (available on the department website in the FORMS section), as you will do so during the first week of the thesis class. Who can register me? You register yourself once a place has been opened for you. You will receive an email, after registration begins, listing the specific sections to which you have been admitted. Can I pick a thesis / seminar section? No. Students are assigned to a thesis / seminar section by the honours advisor. This procedure provides an even distribution of the number of thesis students and research topics across all sections. What if I don t yet have confirmation of a place in the honours courses when my date for registration occurs? All the seminar and thesis courses occur at the same time (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 16:15 pm to 18:45). With that schedule in mind, you can register for all your other courses when your date for registration occurs.

Ongoing studies examine risk and resiliency in the offspring of the original Concordia Longitudinal Risk Project participants: a group of several hundred children and adolescents from inner-city backgrounds who have been followed intensively since early childhood.  Specific projects focus on the effects of poverty and environmental stress on children s health over time; predictors of successful trajectories in children who are at risk for school failure; and understanding the environmental, neuro-endocrine and parenting factors in the development of internalizing disorders in children. Specific research projects are funded by CIHR, SSHRC, and FQRSC. Selected publications Fisher, D.B-D., Serbin, L.A., Stack, D.M., Ruttle, P., Ledingham, J.E., & Schwartzman, A.E. (2007).

Parenting, parent-child relationship, quality of interactions, and developmental outcomes in several groups of at-risk dyads, including a sample crossing two generations, are being studied.   Foci in ongoing studies include: (1) intergenerational transfer of psychosocial risk; (2) long-term outcomes of childhood aggression and social withdrawal; (3) the development of very low birth weight preterm infants, (4) early health and development, risk and protective factors; (5) parent-infant social interactions and infants' socio-emotional development.

After completing his postdoctoral training with Dr. Yavin Shaham at the National Institute on Drug Abuse/NIH in 2002, he headed the behavioral laboratory in D-Pharm Ltd., Rehovot, Israel. At the same time, he was appointed a senior lecturer at the Academic College Tel Aviv-Yaffo. In 2004 he joined the Department of Psychology and the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia University. He held a Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology of Drug Abuse (Tier II; 2004-2015). Research Drug abuse, Relapse, Animal models, Behavioural neurobiology, Eating disorders Overview Using an animal model for drug self-administration, the research in my lab targets the brain mechanisms underlying the strikingly similar behaviors characterizing drug addiction and eating disorders. In addition, I am interested in the effects of early-life experiences on the development of mental disorders, susceptibility to drug abuse and eating disorders in the adult organism. Drug abuse and eating disorders are having an increasing impact on Western Society. New and more effective treatments are only likely to be developed once the interaction between the neural systems that underlie these disorders are understood. My research involves two main themes that are concerned with factors that promote and maintain substance abuse. The first arises from my previous work showing that food deprivation potently induced relapse to heroin and cocaine seeking in laboratory rats, and that this effect is attenuated by leptin, a hormone involved in appetite regulation and energy balance. These data indicate a link between substance abuse and eating control mechanisms. We use a model of food-restriction-induced relapse to drugs in rats that is based on the drug self-administration procedure. We then examine the brains of the manipulated rats in search of the mechanisms underlying the behavioral phenomena. The second theme is concerned with the often-reported comorbidity of drug abuse with mental disorders, and more specifically, eating disorders. We are using activity-induce anorexia as a model for anorexia nervosa to study factors that affect vulnerability to drugs and natural rewards and identify changes in underlying neuromechanisms.

It deals with psychosocial risk factors in childhood which increase the likelihood of disordered behavior and maladaptive lifestyles in adulthood. Our Concordia Longitudinal Risk Research Program which began in 1976 has been following inner-city aggressive and withdrawn French-speaking children into adulthood. The aim is to determine the factors that differentiate the developmental trajectories of at-risk children who do well from those who fare badly. The children are now in their thirties; so my current interest is in how they are doing in such domains as mental and physical health, employment, competence, affiliative ties, and parenting. I have a particular interest in gender role socialization, life stresses, social support, and coping efficacy as influences on outcomes in these domains of adult functioning. Studies in the risk research program currently deal with stress; intergenerational continuities of risk factors; and childhood predictors of adult adjustment.

My MA program included a specialization                                    in early childhood education and I spent many                                    hours working in the University Laboratory Nursery                                    School under the supervision of Dr. Mary   J. Wright.                                  Following the MA I spent   five long years living                                  in Edmonton,   Alberta. I worked as an Assistant                                    Supervisor, Edmonton Northwest Day Care Center,                                    which was a municipally funded day care center.                                    I also completed a post-degree program in Elementary                                    Education at the University of Alberta   and after                                  two years of teaching I   received my professional                                  certification   as an elementary school teacher.                                  During   one year I was a counsellor in an elementary                                    school and in the second year, I taught a special                                    education class. Subsequently I attended the   University                                  of Waterloo and completed my   Ph.D. in Developmental                                  Psychology in   1986.

Furthermore,                                      I am interested in how siblings co-construct                                      meaning in their relationship through play,                                      caretaking, teaching and use of   internal state                                    language (i.e.,   references to emotional, mental                                      states). Recently my work has focussed on young                                      children's social knowledge and understanding                                      of the sibling relationship, particularly within                                      the pretend play context. Currently I am   examining                                    the relations between   children pretense negotiations                                    and   conflict resolution, as well as the development                                      of intersubjectivity in sibling play and associations                                      with the quality of the relationship.   Another                                    project is investigating the   associations between                                    disclosure,   intimacy, and the quality of children                                      peer relationships in middle childhood. My current                                      SSHRC-funded project is to examine sibling teaching                                      from a social-constructivist framework. Influence of the design of dramatic play                                      centers on children's play: How the ecology of the early childhood classroom,                                      specifically dramatic play centers, affects                                      children's social and cognitive play.   This project                                    has both a theoretical   and applied focus. Based                                    on theory   regarding the importance of pretend                                      play in young children's development, I have                                      conducted a series of studies to determine how                                      to facilitate opportunities for dramatic play                                      in the early childhood classroom. Several of                                      my MA students have investigated   other aspects                                    of play, such as the   relationship between solitary                                    play   and children thinking styles or the influence                                      of different kinds of play materials (e.g.,                                      superhero or scripted toys) on children. Child care: Specifically recent                                      child care research and implications for Canadian                                      public policy. The majority of recent research                                      on child care emanates from the United   States,                                    however the Canadian context   differs from the                                    American in   significant economic and philosophical                                      ways. My work (with E. Jacobs) has pointed to                                      the importance of considering these differences                                      for the development of child care policy.   Professor                                    Jacobs and I are currently   engaged in a pan-Canadian                                    study of   curriculum in child care settings funded                                      through Human Resources Development Canada.                                      Specifically we are looking at provincial regulations                                      and guidelines for curriculum in child care                                      settings and how curriculum is taught   to future                                    educators enrolled in   community colleges. We                                    will also   conduct an inservice intervention                                      program focused on constructivist curriculum                                      for child care workers in three provinces (Manitoba,                                      Nova Scotia, Quebec).

Using neurophysiological techniques, students and myself aim to identify how the activity in the brain is coordinated, either in the basic rhythmicity or in a functional manner. We use recordings from many electrodes to describe brain waves and nerve cell activity. In the cerebellum specifically, it is not yet known how groups of cells interact to produce coordinated sensation and behavior. Techniques used in the lab focus on describing the underlying mechanisms shaping populations of neurons, using signals from many single units as well as field potentials in vivo in the awake or anesthetized animal. I study the neurophysiology of neuronal oscillations, centering on the cerebellum and basal ganglia.

My work has sought to answer questions pertaining to two distinct yet integrative learning processes:  What are the neural mechanisms that drive association formation between stimuli and in particular the establishment of predictive relationships as informed by error correcting mechanisms?  A complementary question pertains to the nature of the representations that enter into associative relationships.  Thus my second line of research is aimed at understanding how complex stimuli are represented in the brain and in particular how such stimuli can be updated and incorporated into new mnemonic events. My approach to the study of brain and behavior is to combine well-controlled behavioral designs informed by formalized theories of learning and causal (disruptive, modulatory pharmacological and optogenetic methods) and correlational (cell recording) neuroscience techniques.

Biography Mihaela Iordanova completed her undergraduate studies at the University of New South Wales where she was awarded a Bachelor s degree with Honors in Psychology in 2001.  She conducted her doctoral studies on the role of the accumbal opioid and dopamine transmission in error-correction in the fear setting at the same institution under the guidance of R. Frederick Westbrook.  As part of her doctoral research Mihaela visited the laboratory of Simon Killcross at Cardiff University where she embarked on research examining the role of dopamine in predicting fear.  Following completion of her PhD in 2006, Mihaela sought post-doctoral training back in the learning theory hub that is the School of Psychology at Cardiff University.  There she worked with prominent scientists including Rob Honey and Mark Good on the neurocircuitry of mnemonic integration and updating, and forged strong collaborations with John Pearce, John Aggleton, and Dominic Dwyer.  Her desire to study how the neurons change their pattern of firing as a result of environmental stimulation took her across the Atlantic to the laboratory of Geoffrey Schoenbaum. While holding appointments at University of Maryland and at the National Institute of Drug Abuse, she examined how cells in the central nucleus of the amygdala modulate their firing under conditions when fewer than expected rewards are delivered.  Mihaela was awarded a prestigious Pathways to Independence (K99/R00) award from the National Institutes of Health to conduct this work.  In 2014 Mihaela was appointed as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychology where she joins the Centre for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology. Back to top ", "title": "Faculty"},

My current work focuses on three major research questions:  a) What are the neuro-computationalmechanisms underlying learning in uncertain, dynamically changing environments and how do these learning processes develop across the human lifespan?  b) How does the ability to arbitrate between different learning strategies change as a function of age?  c) How do humans learn from the behavior of other individuals and how does this ability change during lifespan development?  Toaddress these questions I use a multi-methodological approach that combines experimental paradigms, computational modeling and neuroimaging (EEG, fMRI). Selected Publications Nassar, M.

These difficulties include (but are not limited to) depression, impulsivity or eating disorders.  Early adverse exposures in utero or in the first years of life can affect the brain in many different ways; however, the neurotransmitter serotonin is of particular interest. That is because serotonin is (i) widely implicated in a variety of psychopathologies and (ii) important for brain development, especially during infancy or childhood  (i.e., serotonin, in fact, helps to actually  build up the brain ). The overarching theme of our research program is that early adversity could disrupt the stability of certain brain chemicals (e.g., serotonin). This in turn influences the early development of brain regions involved in emotion regulation, and could predispose the individual to psychological problems later in life, particularly when exposed to subsequent stressful events. The studies we are conducting are done in clinical and non-clinical populations and use neuro-imaging (fMRI/PET), epigenetics (DNA methylation) and/or cognitive-behavioural assessments, and is funded by various sources, including CIHR and NARSAD.  Topics of ongoing research projects include: - Impact of childhood trauma on brain processes and (risk for) mental health problems in adolescence and adulthood. - Effect of cognitive-behavioural interventions on DNA methylation and brain function in adolescents with depression. - DNA methylation, childhood trauma and psychopathology (in particular mood disorders and eating disorders). - Impact of peer victimization on brain development and DNA methylation - Gene-Environment studies on brain and mental health, using twin designs. - Impact of early stress on oral health. - Impact of in utero Bisphenol-A (BPA) exposure on brain development in children Education PhD (Leiden University, the Netherlands) Teaching activities Psychopathology: Mood, Anxiety, and Personality Disorders (Psyc 440, winter 2016 and 2017) Practicum Neuropsychology (2016-2017) Publications Selected recent publications Booij, L., Welfeld, K., Leyton, M., Dagher, A., Boileau, I., Sibon, I., Baker, G.B.,  Diksic, M., Soucy, J-P., Pruessner, J.C., Cawley   Fiset, E., Casey, K.F., Benkelfat, C.(2016).

Concordia Vanier scholar Poppy Wilkinson investigates The PhD researcher examines narcissism in early adolescence Posted on December 16, 2015 | Source: University Communications Services What is the  healthy self  in early adolescents? That s the fundamental question behind Poppy Wilkinson's proposal to the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships program . Poppy Wilkinson:  My interests have always been about people   how people get along as a society, how they navigate the world.  Wilkinson, a Concordia MA and first-year PhD student in the university's  Department of Psychology , now has the financial support to focus on finding the answer. She landed the research scholarship in 2014 and, after a brief deferral, is now  joining Concordia's three 2015 Vanier recipients . The Government of Canada launched the Vanier program in 2008 to strengthen the country s ability to attract and retain world-class doctoral students, and establish Canada as a global centre of excellence in research and higher learning.  Annually, 167 Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships are awarded to national and international students. Winners receive $50,000 each, for three years. Narcissism, interrupted The official title of Wilkinson's project is  The Social Consequences of Self-Distortions During Early Adolescence: A Cross-Cultural Perspective.   I ll be studying the social functioning of early adolescents who see themselves more positively than is objectively warranted,  she says.  This kind of distortion in self-concept is known as narcissism.  She clarifies that she isn t studying the narcissistic personality disorder found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.  I m looking at what they call 'childhood normal narcissism.' While in the past, narcissism has been considered a disorder, recently it has also come to be understood as a normal-range individual difference.  Narcissism is characterized by a self-view that is at once grandiose and fragile, as it is highly contingent on the validation of others. It is associated with a host of negative behaviours including impulsivity, aggression, increased risk taking and exploitation, as well as unstable interpersonal relationships.  Surprisingly little is known about how narcissism functions in adulthood or childhood, particularly with respect to social experiences and peer groups,  adds Wilkinson.  In the literature, narcissism is usually assessed with self-report measures, but because narcissism plays out in the social realm, the perspective of peers is also important and interesting.  3 research goals Wilkinson's research comprises a three-part project concerning the social consequences of childhood normal narcissism in 10-to-12-year-olds in Canada, the Netherlands and Colombia. She ll be working out of the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory , which is also known as the Bukowski Lab, in reference to William Bukowski , a psychology professor at Concordia. It s part of the Centre for Research in Human Development (CRDH) . Wilkinson s three research goals are: 1. To clarify the association between narcissism, social validation and aggression 2. To better understand the social status of children high in narcissism 3. To explore cultural variations in adolescents' self-concept, and how these children function in their diverse social worlds  The results could lead to practical implications for educational settings,  says Wilkinson.  Some children benefit from initiatives aimed to boost self-esteem, but other children who feel superior may benefit from a different kind of intervention.  From English lit to psychology How did Wilkinson go from a BA in English literature to pursuing her PhD in psychology?  My interests have always been about people   how people get along as a society, how they navigate the world, why they do the things they do and what consequences this has for them and for those around them,  she says.  Analyzing the complex patterns and themes of human behavior is what attracted me to earn a bachelor s degree in English literature with a minor in socio-cultural anthropology. Indeed, a key element of any good story lies in how an individual s life history intersects with his or her social and cultural context.  It is these same core interests that drew Wilkinson to research peer relations in developmental psychology and, more specifically, cross-cultural individual differences in self-concept.

But are there hidden benefits to being bilingual? Research from Concordia reveals a new perk visible in the problem-solving skills of toddlers. The results of a study recently published by the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology show that bilingual children are better than monolinguals at a certain type of mental control, and that those children with more practice switching between languages have even greater skills. Bilingual speakers can thank the sometimes-arduous practice of switching from one language to another for this skill.  This switching becomes more frequent as children grow older and as their vocabulary size increases,  says Diane Poulin-Dubois, a professor in Concordia s Department of Psychology and the study s senior author.  Therefore, the superior performance on these conflict tasks appears to be due to bilinguals  strengthened cognitive flexibility and selective attention abilities as they have increased experience in switching across languages in expressive vocabulary.  Poulin-Dubois and Cristina Crivello, a graduate student with Concordia s Centre for Research in Human Development (CRDH), led a group of researchers* in a longitudinal investigation, which compared bilingual toddlers to their monolingual peers, tracking the tots as they gained greater vocabularies in each of their two languages. For the study, the researchers assessed the vocabularies of 39 bilingual children and 43 monolinguals when they were aged 24 months, and then again at 31 months. During the second assessment, the researchers also had the young participants perform a battery of tasks to test their cognitive flexibility and memory skills.  For the most part, there was no difference between the bilingual and monolingual toddlers,  says Poulin-Dubois, who is also a member of CRDH.  But that changed dramatically when it came to the conflict inhibition test, and the differences were especially apparent in the bilingual toddlers whose vocabulary had increased most.  In this case, conflict inhibition refers to the mental process of overriding a well learned rule that you would normally pay attention to. To assess toddlers  abilities in this domain, Crivello, who undertook the research as part of her master s thesis and is the first author of the study, administered two tests: Reverse categorization  participants were told to put a set of little blocks into a little bucket and big blocks into a big bucket. Then the instructions were switched   big blocks in the little bucket and little blocks in the big bucket. Shape conflict   participants were shown pictures of different sized fruit and asked to name them. Then a new series of images was shown, with a small fruit embedded inside a large one. Toddlers were asked to point to the little fruit. It wasn t surprising to the researchers that the bilingual children performed significantly better on the conflict inhibition tasks than did their monolingual counterparts.  Language switching underlies the bilingual advantage on conflict tasks,  says Crivello.  In conflict inhibition, the child has to ignore certain information   the size of a block relative to a bucket, or the fact that one fruit is inside another. That mirrors the experience of having to switch between languages, using a second language even though the word from a first language might be more easily accessible.  The unique feature of the study was the finding that the more language switching toddlers engaged in, the more it benefitted them. Within the bilingual group of toddlers, those who had amassed a greater number of  doublets    pairs of words in each language, such as dog/chien   performed even better on the conflict inhibition tasks.  By the end of the third year of life, the average bilingual child uses two words for most concepts in his or her vocabulary, so young bilingual children gradually acquire more experience in switching between languages,  says Poulin-Dubois. *Partners in research: This research was supported by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The study s additional co-authors are Olivia Kuzyk and Monyka Rodrigues (Concordia University), Margaret Friend (San Diego State University) and Pascal Zesiger (Universit  de Gen ve).

The celebration grew out of the annual Dean s Awards ceremony, which celebrated the achievements of staff and faculty.  This year, we wanted to expand the evening to include our new Concordia University Research Chairs, Canada Research Chairs and other research chairs, whose incredible work highlights the strengths of our faculty every day,  said Andr  Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science. Jason Camlot , associate dean of Faculty Affairs, oversaw the selection committee for the awards. He noted the overwhelming number of recommendations the three winners received. Winning staff members received a $500 gift certificate, and faculty members received $500 in research funding.   Staff and faculty award winners Gilles Pelsherbe , a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , won for Distinguished Scholarship in the Senior Scholar Category.  He is an extremely productive researcher,  said Camlot. Viviane Namaste , a professor in the Simone de Beauvoir Institute , won for Teaching Excellence. Camlot praised her for her extensive mentorship over the years.  Her students have been transformed by her personal interventions, and by her example,  he said. But perhaps the most memorable of the three winners was Ron Rehel , who recently retired from the Department of Exercise Science as a technical supervisor, following a 36-year career. Rehel received a standing ovation from the crowd when he accepted his award for Exceptional Service to the Faculty.  I always held the Concordia family in high esteem,  said Rehel.  It was a pleasure to work with these folks. In so many ways they are the reason I ended up receiving my award. I love my Concordia life!    Chair winners Next, the faculty s new research chairs were honoured.  They are chosen because of the vision for research in the faculty that they articulated in their applications for chair, and the leadership that they are expected to provide by holding the chair,  said Kim Sawchuk, the faculty s associate dean, Research and Graduate Studies. When he presented the chairs with their certificates and prizes, Roy put the academics on the spot. He asked them to sum up their field of research in one sentence. Thanh Dang-Vu , assistant professor and a Concordia Research Chair joked,  I put people to sleep.  He s a leader in the field of sleep study. Following the ceremony, guests had the chance to mix and mingle with honourees, department chairs, colleagues, friends and family.

Linda Booij A strategic hire in trauma intervention for her department, Booij also recently joined the team of 40 researchers at Concordia s PERFORM Centre , which aims to improve health through scholarly inquiry, teaching and a wide range of community programs. Serotonin is important in mood and memory, among other functions, and has long been studied in relation to anxiety, depression, aggression and even suicidal impulses. Booij says her own work focuses on serotonin's role in the development of the human brain before birth and in early childhood. In particular, she's interested in the epigenetics of the question of how external environmental factors can cause genes to be \"switched on\" or \"turned off\" in the fetus and infant; and how it affects brain development. Gene activity is mainly determined by DNA, but scientists now know that an individual's environment can trigger some genes and quieten others. The challenge for Booij is to better understand how stresses during pregnancy and in the first years of life may lead to unwelcome changes via serotonin and other neurotransmitters.  We know from animal work that environmental factors can influence your neurochemicals, in utero and in childhood,\" Booij says. It is important to note that external stresses \"don't mean a person is stuck for life,  she adds.  There are many ways to compensate   you're not doomed to depression for example.\" Consequences may be modified, if not reversed, by, for instance, sound parenting, she says. A positive and enriching environment for an infant may help to compensate for perinatal stresses and early childhood adversity to the brain's development. \"We would expect from animal work that brain plasticity can take place: the brain is prone to change by environmental factors,  Booij says.  There is some evidence that some damage can be compensated for.\" She's studying the genes that regulate serotonin, but also those linked to other neurotransmitters, as well as to hormones and biochemicals that affect human brain development and behaviour. Her work involves neuro-imaging, and PERFORM, on the Loyola Campus, has equipment for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning. \"With this equipment we can look at the structure of the brain and how it responds to certain stimuli, and look at specific neurotransmitters.\" It's a complicated and important field. \"In the long term my research, a better understanding of early brain development, might help develop treatment, prevention and intervention programs for at-risk populations.\" Find out more about research at the PERFORM Centre .

Her lab   which studies fear, reward and memory   is a Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) project with a total value of approximately $375,000 (including cash contributions from Qu bec's Minist re de l' ducation et de l'Enseignement sup rieur and from Concordia, and in-kind contributions from equipment suppliers). What is the goal of your research? Mihaela Iordanova: The research in my lab focuses on understanding the behavioural and neural mechanisms that guide learning about the world around us. We seek to understand what neural circuits are involved in how we come to expect rewarding or fearful events, as well as how we update these expectations in our dynamic environments. Updated memories can be fickle and subject to disruption, so we aim to develop ways to strengthen such recent memories. Sometimes, the stimuli that we base our expectations on are complex mnemonic events, which combine cues from diverse modalities such as a particular place or time. Our work also seeks to understand the nature of such complex memories. What do you hope will be the impact on society and your field of study? MI: Our work examines both fear and reward, and we hope to integrate and better understand the interaction between these opposing motivational states. We seek to uncover which circuits, as opposed to individual brain areas, process reward and fear, as well as provide a novel understanding of their interaction behaviourally and neutrally, something that has remained largely elusive but has attracted much interest in recent times. Indeed, exaggeration in the processing of rewarding events translates to similar exaggerated processing of aversive events, and this has been linked to addiction. The paradigms we use in our work represent animal models of psychopathologies such as addiction, obesity and anxiety. Examining the integration of fear and reward will provide a novel take on the psychological and neural mechanisms of these conditions. Ultimately, we hope to establish behavioural paradigms, which can inform and lead to the development of novel treatments for addiction, obesity and anxiety. Now that you've won a Canada Research Chair (CRC), what next steps do you hope to take?  MI: The CRC will allow the lab to continue our research on fear and reward, but will also provide us with a way to delve into these questions using advanced optogenetic, pharamacogenetic and real-time neural recording techniques. This provides a means to elucidate the neural mechanisms of reward and fear from the cell to the circuit level. Our lab will push the boundaries of the neurobiology of fear and reward expectation, as well as memory formation by integrating theoretical stipulations of learning with neural techniques that prod brain function in real time and examine how alterations in brain function influence information processing.

Ryder Is Denmark the happiest country in the world? | Photo by Giuseppe Milo (Flickr CC) According to the 2016 World Happiness Report , Denmark is (once again) the happiest country in the world, and thus we should study their society closely to see what they're doing right ... But is it that simple? Here, Andrew G. Ryder , associate professor and director of clinical training in Concordia s Department of Psychology , evaluates the methodology behind the fourth edition of the global survey and shines a light on how metrics and indices are at play: For millennia, philosophers, theologians and many others have argued about what constitutes the  good life.  While some thinkers have emphasized objective markers, particularly economic indicators, others have advocated a broader view that encompasses personal and/or collective well-being. Aristotle s eudaimonia is not merely happiness as maximizing positive emotions, but encompasses wisdom, personal virtue and so on. Social scientists have joined the fray in recent decades. Beyond the GDP The rankings, and the accompanying report, have several advantages. First, the coverage of the study is impressive, and considers most countries in the world   ranging from Denmark (top rank) to Burundi (bottom rank). Second, the resulting index and rankings help move the debate beyond economic indicators. This encourages societies to evaluate policies in terms of their impact on the well-being of their citizens, not merely on whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is increased. Of course, it may well be good to increase GDP, but we could then judge the benefits of such an increase in terms of their impact on human-centred goals, rather than treating economy-centred goals as ends in themselves. Third, the approach taken in this survey was to ask respondents to rank their relative position on a 10-rung ladder from  the best possible life for you  down to  the worst possible life for you.  This method is a marked improvement from older cross-national surveys that used rating scales to measure  happiness  levels. Fourth, the end results are easy to understand, communicate and discuss, helping to fuel a debate about what really matters both within and across different societies. Assumptions behind the numbers  My major concern with these kinds of studies   with the straightforward presentation of national \"league tables\" and their seeming ease of interpretation   is that there are a lot of assumptions buried in these numbers. The authors themselves do an admirable job of covering many concerns, exceptions, interpretive challenges and so on in their report   but the number of people who will read the report will surely be dwarfed by the number of people who read the news coverage and quickly look up their own country s standing. But is happiness actually the end goal against which we would want to evaluate all other goals? What if certain kinds of wisdom make us less happy, but better in other ways? What if happiness within a country is boosted at the expense of happiness in a neighbouring country, or if present happiness is being boosted at the expense of future generations? Complicating matters further, it s not entirely clear that happiness is the best word to use. Unlike many previous studies, the word happiness is not actually used in the main task, which assesses self-perceived quality of life. This approach represents a methodological advance in many ways, but it does complicate the interpretation: the jump to happiness, to the high arousal positive emotional state signified by the English word  happiness  is not straightforward. Cross-national comparisons These kinds of problems are inevitably compounded by cross-national comparisons, especially when people shaped by different cultural contexts respond to the task in different ways. For example, is it possible to raise people s self-perceived quality of life by lowering expectations, so that one s vision of  the best possible life for you  is constrained? In my field of cultural psychology, we have learned that cross-national comparisons are hampered by the \"reference group effect\" where people in different cultural contexts respond to rating scales by comparing themselves with their perception of average people living in their own local environment. Cultural psychologists have also found that people in different cultural contexts vary in terms of which emotional states are most desirable in the first place: whereas many Americans place a premium on  the pursuit of happiness,  many people living in East Asian societies show a marked preference for low arousal positive emotions such as  tranquility.  There is even evidence from Russia showing that people can even value negative emotions as more useful, as more authentic, as part of a richly lived life. Beware of national stereotypes about emotions Another problem with these sorts of cross-national analyses is that subgroup differences are masked. I can just about believe a single score to represent Luxembourg, but what does a single score for China or India even mean? Should we really average Tibet s happiness into China s overall score? These are vast countries with considerable regional diversity, not to mention ethnic, religious, urban-rural and many other important distinctions. To be fair, the authors are admirably clear about this issue, noting that there are wide discrepancies across various groups within each country. But the average reader is likely to miss these points and focus instead on the rankings. We are then a short distance from aggregate  happiness  scores to national stereotypes about emotions. A conclusion such as:  Denmark s sociocultural, political, and economic situation has helped it to become a country where many people rate themselves as at or close to the best life they can imagine for themselves,  becomes:  Danes are the happiest people in the world!  Alternate indices, different results  So I am pleased to see that this ambitious study is helping to move the discussion about national priorities beyond GDP, but hope the discussion continues to move beyond happiness rankings. Remember, we could change the survey question to reflect a different view of happiness, or change the criteria to yield different rankings. We could decide that societies should be judged on the happiness of the poorest 10 per cent, or the happiness of the most disadvantaged demographic subgroup or the ratio of happiness to environmental footprint, etc. There are numerous alternative indices that could help get us beyond GDP, each one with particular assumptions, and each one of which would yield somewhat different results.

What better time to celebrate Concordians working in the field of sleep research? Looking at everyone from children to the elderly, Concordia s researchers are studying the patterns, influences and consequences of sleep. Jennifer McGrath: stress and sleep  My research focuses on how sleep impacts heart health and obesity in children   specifically, why poor families have poor health,  says Jennifer McGrath , associate professor in the Department of Psychology and Concordia s inaugural PERFORM Chair in Childhood Preventive Health and Data Science. \"The stress of being poor gets under their skin, literally, and stress seems to make its biggest impact while we're sleeping.\" Here, at the 2015 Chancellor s Builders Dinner, McGrath s discusses how sleep is critical for good health: &amp;nbsp; A new study from September 2015, led by researchers Jinshia Ly, McGrath and Jean-Philippe Gouin from Concordia s Centre for Clinical Research in Health (CCRH) and the PERFORM Centre , shows that poor sleep might explain how stress impacts health in kids.  Getting a good night s sleep might buffer the impact of stress on kids  cortisol level, which is a hormone produced in the adrenal gland to regulate the body s cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems,  says McGrath, also the director of Concordia s Pediatric Public Health Psychology (PPHP) Laboratory .  Long-term exposure to cortisol can put people at risk for health problems, like heart diseases, weight gain and depression.  This study was part of the larger, ongoing Healthy Heart Project directed by McGrath. It was made possible by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Operating Grant awarded to McGrath and the Fonds de recherche du Qu bec   Sant  bourse de formation ma trise awarded to Ly. The CIHR funding was renewed and the project is funded until 2020. Thanh Dang-Vu: ageing and sleep What is the relationship between sleep and cognition in older adults? Neurologist Thanh Dang-Vu , assistant professor in the Department of Exercise Science, is currently recruiting people over the age of 65 for a sleep study to get some answers.  Thanh Dang-Vu:  Sleep becomes more fragile as you age and the prevalence of insomnia increases.   Sleep becomes more fragile as you age and the prevalence of insomnia increases,  says Dang-Vu, Concordia Research Chair in Sleep, Neuroimaging and Cognitive Health at Concordia s Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology and the PERFORM Centre, is also a medical doctor at the Institut universitaire de g riatrie de Montr al .  In the general population, chronic insomnia, which is insomnia for more than three months, is about 10 to 15 per cent. In the elderly, people older than 65, insomnia rates can be between 30 and 34 per cent, or one third of the population   at least double that of younger people,  he says.  That's a problem, Dang-Vu explains, because the population is more fragile. Insomniacs have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety. Too often, insomnia is treated with sleeping pills and patients become dependent. Cognition concerns  We ve recruited 20 participants over 65 years of age who take benzodiazepines   like Ativan, Klonopin and Serax, for example   to spend the night at our sleep lab,  says Dang-Vu, who won the 2015 Roger Broughton Young Investigator Award from the  Canadian Sleep Society  in recognition of his significant early career contributions to the field of sleep research in Canada.  We re offering them a treatment called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI),  says Dang-Vu, who wants to see if CBTI will improve their cognition.  If that's the case, it would emphasize the importance of treating insomnia for maintaining good cognitive function with age,  he says.  With age, we have a larger risk of developing memory problems. Sleep might be one of these aspects that help prevent the development of dementia. It s important to look at that.

From left: Miriam Roland, Steven Heine, Andrew Ryder and Virginia Penhune. The genomic revolution Heine s first slide in the presentation was also the title of his upcoming book, DNA Is Not Destiny. What and how we think about genes, he opened, can be distorted by people believing in something he calls  essences    invisible, inherent forces at play   and projecting those essentialist biases onto genetics. For example, when a transplant recipient thinks they inherited traits of the donor.  People the world over are essentialist thinkers,  he said.  They are attracted to the idea that hidden essences make things as they are. And because genetic concepts remind people of essences, they tend to think of genes in ways similar to essences. That is, people tend to think about genetic causes as immutable, deterministic, homogenous, discrete and natural.  Heine went on to examine how essentialist biases lead people to think differently about sex, sexual orientation, race, ancestry, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), crime, eugenics and disease whenever these are described in genetic terms.  Our essentialist biases make people vulnerable to the sensationalist hype that has emerged with the genomic revolution and access to direct-to-consumer genotyping services,  concluded Heine, who recommends more genetic education for the general public to reduce essentialist thinking and counteract the idea that genetic causes are inevitable.

About one in 68 children in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Their parents consistently report greater stress levels, caregiving burden and depression than parents of typically developing children. Chronic caregiving stress has also been associated with poorer physical health   more pain, more disruptions from physical-health problems and lower overall health-related quality of life. One powerful way to reduce their stress: social support. That s according to a new study published in Family Relations by researchers from Concordia. And that support is essential as children   and their parents   age. It could also have important consequences for health costs. For the study, psychology professors Jean-Philippe Gouin and Erin T. Barker , as well as their co-authors, investigated whether social support can protect against stress-induced immune problems. They asked 56 healthy parents of children with ASD to complete questionnaires on formal social support (provided by health or social services professionals), informal social support (provided by significant others, friends and family) as well as self-rated health and recent somatic symptoms. Study participants also provided blood samples to check for inflammation   the automatic reaction of the innate immune system upon exposure to infection, injury or abnormal cells, or psychological stress. Chronic low-grade inflammation is also associated with greater risk for several age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, certain cancers, autoimmune diseases, frailty, dementia and early mortality. The results indicated that greater informal social support was associated with lower inflammation, and that a higher number of formal support services received by the family was related to better self-rated health and lower inflammation. Notably, the impact of support services on the parents  inflammation levels increased with the age of the affected child.  The impact of chronic caregiving stress on health likely becomes more pronounced as the parents are aging and their immune system responds less efficiently to challenges,  says Gouin.  The need for formal and informal support thus remains high even as the child with ASD is becoming an adult.  He adds that the study results emphasize the need for continued services for these families, who are experiencing lifelong parenting challenges.  Given the reciprocal relationship between child and parental health and well-being, supporting the parents in coping with chronic caregiving stress might not only improve the child s outcome, but also may help maintain an optimal family environment for a longer period of time. Supporting the parents in providing care to their children with ASD might then represent a cost-effective strategy in the long-term.  Gouin is now continuing this research by following families during their ASD-affected children s last years of high school and the first few years after graduation to examine the impact of social support services on parental health. Currently, 120 families are participating, but Gouin hopes to recruit 100 more in the next two years.

A Concordia study explores the stigma-fighting power of tablets   and their low-cost benefits for the visually impaired Posted on March 22, 2016 | Version fran aise  Tablet computers offer many of the same benefits while being socially acceptable.  | Photo by Sebastien Wiertz The proportion of older adults with age-related vision loss is estimated to be as high as one in three over the age of 50. In Canada, that s roughly 3.6 million people. Many of these individuals turn to adaptive devices designed to magnify objects and text, but these devices can be prohibitively expensive, uni-functional and bulky. Enter the iPad: a technological device that s relatively cheap, serves many purposes, is smaller than most books, and   according to new research from Concordia   is just as effective a visual aid as traditional devices. A study recently described in Good Times Magazine provides the first experimental evidence that the Apple iPad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment. And that could help with stigmatization of the elderly and disabled. For the study, the Concordia-based research team recruited 100 participants who ranged in age from 24 to 97. A little over half the participants had age-related macular degeneration, a disease characterized by the deterioration of the small central portion of the retina that is normally responsible for fine detailed vision tasks such as reading. The researchers used questionnaires and tests to gauge participants  visual ability, and then compared the Apple iPad versus two traditionally used magnification devices, to see if reading rates varied across devices.  Unsurprisingly, we found that most participants found it hard to read small and medium text, while nearly a quarter of them reported that reading large text was much easier,  says Elliott Morrice, an MA student in Concordia s Department of Psychology and the study s first author.  What was interesting to note was that it didn t matter what technology was used to do the magnification: an iPad worked just as well as a traditional device like a closed circuit television system (CCTV),  he says.  When we took previous experience into account, we found that participants who had used iPads before read on average 30 words per minute faster than those who were using the iPad for the first time. But there were no significant differences in the reading rates of participants who had previous experience using the CCTV, compared to the reading rates of first-time CCTV users.  Another benefit is that many older adults feel stigmatized by using the traditional devices, because they identify them as having an impairment or disability.  Tablet computers offer many of the same benefits while being socially acceptable,  says Aaron Johnson , the study s senior author, and an associate professor in the psychology department, and a member of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal (CRIR).   What s more, compared to the devices currently used by those with low vision, iPads are multi-functional, allowing the user to go online, check email, make video calls   and they cost less than the traditional devices,  he says.  This cost saving can be both to the individual, and if appropriate, to the insurance companies that may provide individuals with assistive devices.

Concordia student Meagan Boisse investigates Posted on May 12, 2016 | By: Meagan Boisse Am I missing something? What is it with the number 13? | Photo by Angela Rutherford (Flickr CC) Meagan Boisse is a journalism undergraduate. She currently writes A Concordian abroad , a column about her term at the Danish School of Media and Journalism. Tomorrow is Friday the 13th, commonly accepted as the unluckiest day of the year for anyone who isn t a serial killer . While many scoff at the superstitious occasion, some 17 to 21 million people in the United States reportedly suffer from \"friggatriskaidekaphobia,\"  the clinical term for being spooked by this most freaky of Fridays. Why are we afraid? In 2004, the North Carolina Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute estimated the United States loses $800 to 900 million in business on Fridays that coincide with the 13th day of the month, as superstitious consumers are too terrified to go about their daily lives.  You just need enough people talking about something in a scary enough way to then become apprehensive about it yourself,  says Adam Radomsky , a professor of psychology at Concordia .  Once that happens it s very easy not only to worry, but also to tie all minor negative events that could happen at any given time to the superstition.  Val rie De Courville Nicol , a professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology , says society s need for control and catharsis is part of Friday the 13th.  I think that in contemporary culture we have a particularly strong fear of anything that is uncertain, uncontrollable and unpredictable,  she says.  We live in a control-oriented culture, so we don't have much tolerance for irrational phenomena. It's almost as if this day is a culturally legitimate day during which people can express the feelings they can't let themselves express normally. It s a ritualized relationship that has a function in allowing people to put their fears somewhere.  But De Courville Nicol believes that being afraid is not always a bad thing.  You can understand it from a psychological perspective as an irrational fear, but many of the fears that we share in common as a group help produce our identity and our feeling of belonging.  The origin of Friday the 13th Folklorists aren t exactly sure where the most feared date in history comes from . No written evidence for the superstition exists prior to the 19th century. The working theory is that Friday the 13 is actually the product of two separate fears working in tandem. The first is the fear of the number 13 , and the second is the Christian-rooted superstition that Fridays are unlucky, stemming from the belief that it was the day of Crucifixion. As far as the number 13 goes, people have seemingly always been wary of it. Even the Babylonians omitted it from their Code of Hammurabi . Numerologists suspect this could be because it is an outlier of the number 12, thought to be the representation of completeness and perfection. Think about it: 12 apostles of Christ, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 gods of Olympus, 12 zodiac signs, 12 months in a year, 12 hours on the clock. The number has also been spoiling dinner parties for the last few millennia. It is believed that if 13 people dine together, at least one will die within the year. This harkens back to biblical times, as Judas was the 13th person to sit at Christ s table for the last supper   and we all know how that turned out. Fun fact: in the 1880s a society, dubbed the Thirteen Club , was formed to dispel the aforementioned superstition. Members threw 13-people dinner parties on the 13th of every month, and liked to walk under ladders.

On June 17 and 18, alumni of the Centre will return to Concordia for A Night at the Oscar, a monumental retrospective variety show at the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall. How it all began The CAHD was officially created in 1996, but the catalyst for it occurred in 1993 when Lenore Vosberg, a social worker at the West Montreal Readaptation Centre, approached Concordia s Stephen Snow , then a professor of theatre and currently an associate professor of drama therapy and chair of the Department of Creative Arts Therapies, about staging a play with her clients.  It was magical, it just came together. People were astounded. That first play founded a 20-year tradition for the Centre,  says Snow, who recently became the first recipient of the Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health.* Every second year, the CAHD accepts 20 people with developmental disabilities referred by social workers at readaptation centres and CLSCs. Students come Mondays and Fridays for two years. At the end of their second year, they host a big public outreach event, usually a play. The group comes back on Wednesdays for a third and final year   the denouement, if you will. Ethnodramas and 100 original songs  The theme of our show is 'We Can',  says Lenore Vosberg, the CAHD executive director.  The song 'I Can' was from And Alice Dreams ... and we're expanding it to be 'We Can,' which will be our closing number. We have a core group of singers and behind them there will be everybody else, around 65 people, doing sign language for the lyrics.  Part of A Night at the Oscar will be dedicated to honouring the music of Shelley Snow, who has composed more than 100 original songs during her time as the Centre's music therapist. The CAHD has been at the forefront of using ethnodramas   plays based on the performers' lived experiences   as therapy. So far three ethnodramas have been produced, all to tremendous acclaim.   Stephen Goulet performed in 2012's  Our World: A Musical Ethnodrama  and really enjoyed his experience.  Some days were tough. But with all the bad stuff put aside, I loved every minute of it.  Goulet will also be performing in A Night at the Oscar. They always want me to come back, and I never say no.   Taking everyone for who they are  Choreographing the dance numbers for the retrospective is Gelymar Sanchez, a professional dancer and Concordia psychology student. She first began as a volunteer at the Centre in January 2015,  teaching yoga . Sanchez is working on six dance acts for the show, reshaping original choreography for some and creating others from scratch, each movement designed to suit the dancer.  It's about taking everyone for who they are and for their abilities, rather than their disabilities,  she says.  They keep on surprising me and renewing my vision of dance. Some of the participants are so talented, I feel they are five times better than the best professional dancers I've worked with before. They really blow my mind.  From the stage to the big screen The Centre's story is one that has resounded strongly with people far and wide. CBC made a documentary in 2000 about the CAHD play And Alice Dreams... called Finding Wonderland. In 2011, EyeSteelFilm released the documentary The Frog Princes , about the play The Frog & the Princess .  When CBC came, they were going to come for one day. They got so fascinated by the process, they stayed for two weeks,  says Snow. Because the cast for this year's play is comprised of past participants, the 2014-16 group's public outreach event is an art installation, part of which will be on display in the foyer of the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall during the performance nights. Art pieces will be available for sale. Crafts made by the  participants will also be available for purchase.

It was presented to Stephen Snow at the Annual General Meeting of AMI-Quebec Action on Mental Illness on June 7. Related Links ", "title": "A night at the Oscar"},

New Concordia research published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology shows that may be thanks to the hormones that trigger the menstrual cycle.  Women have sometimes reported to doctors that their memory works differently depending on which phase of the menstrual cycle they are in  even during and following pregnancy, or following menopause. This has led scientists to wonder whether estrogen and progesterone could affect memory and problem solving,  says psychology professor Wayne Brake , who co-authored the study.  Our research shows that, rather than impairing memory in general, estrogen and progesterone may instead cause the brain to favour one memory system or strategy over another.    Hormones influence problem-solving For the study, researchers tested 45 women who had regular menstrual cycles. First, participants responded to a  hormonal profile  questionnaire that gathered detailed information on their periods, past pregnancies, contraceptive and synthetic hormone intake history and general life habits. The participants were then given a verbal memory task, such as remembering a list of words, as well as a virtual navigation task, such as finding their way through a maze in a video game, that could be solved in several ways. At the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed on how they solved the tasks from beginning to end. Results were clear: women who were ovulating performed better on the verbal memory task. On the other hand, women tested in their pre-menstrual phase were better at solving spatial navigation tasks. That proves that women tend to use different strategies to solve tasks   such as navigating a maze or remembering a list of words   depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle. Essentially, the study shows that the hormonal changes women experience throughout their cycles have a broader impact than previously believed, and have significant effects on how women approach and solve problems.  This is important scientifically. We and others have previously shown that the levels of estrogen and progesterone in rodents influence different brain regions, affecting various memory systems involved in task-solving,  says Brake.  For example, when estrogen levels are high, female rats will use one type of memory system or strategy versus another to solve a maze. This is the first study to show that this is also true for women, who solve tasks in different ways based on their hormones  'Research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain' For recent PhD graduate Dema Hussain, the study s lead author, these results point to an ongoing bias in scientific research.  Traditionally, researchers and scientists have relied on using male participants   and male rats   in studies to develop drugs and treatments for the general population. But we now know that women respond differently than men,  she says.  I hope that this study emphasizes that more research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain, and that efforts must be made to tailor future research to improve our understanding of the effects of female sex hormones on cognition and memory.

At least one in four Canadians will have an anxiety disorder in their lifetime. While effective therapies for these often-debilitating disorders exist, many sufferers find them very difficult to engage with or complete. This prompted researchers at Concordia to look for ways to make treatment easier to handle for those who need it most. In studies recently published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders and forthcoming in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Concordia psychology researchers Hannah Levy and Adam Radomsky show that the very behaviours people use to avoid anxiety could become part of an effective treatment, and that patients have a significant role to play in deciding when those behaviours are no longer necessary. Radomsky and Levy focus on safety behaviours   things people do to make themselves feel less anxious. Examples include wearing gloves when touching dirty objects, avoiding eye contact during stressful interactions, distracting yourself when doing something scary   any behaviour that increases feelings of safety in anxiety-provoking situations.  Traditionally, psychologists thought that fading out or eliminating these behaviours entirely should be the primary focus of the therapy used to combat anxiety disorders. But we found that changing those behaviours and giving patients greater agency is much more effective,  says Radomsky, professor in Concordia s Department of Psychology and senior author of the studies. He and Levy followed 157 study participants   ranging from people with low-level anxieties to those diagnosed OCD   as they adapted old habits with new ones that they could use to avoid anxiety during exposure therapy, in which the therapist exposes the patient to feared objects or situations without any danger. The researchers found that using new safety behaviours during exposure therapy was slightly more helpful to participants than their usual or typical safety behaviours. They also found that the most important aspect of reducing the use of safety behaviours in therapy is that the client or patient be the one who decides when they are ready to move forward without them.   This is different from the standard approach in which therapists encourage people to drop their safety behaviours at the outset of the therapy, which often leads people to drop out or refuse the treatment. Under the right conditions, safety behaviours have the potential to make the therapy more effective, and more acceptable,  explains Levy, who recently defended her PhD in psychology at Concordia and will graduate this summer. Radomsky, who also holds a Concordia University Research Chair in Anxiety and Related Disorders, says the results of the research could help therapists shape their approach to best help each person with whom they re working.  It s our hope that these findings will help to reduce the number of people who refuse or drop out of cognitive behavioural therapies and should result in more people getting the help that they need.

Concordia researchers explain how fancy glassware and the sight of a liquor store can facilitate alcohol addiction Posted on May 25, 2016 | Version fran aise  Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues.  | Photo by Photholic (Flickr CC) Humans aren t much different from other animals. Just like Pavlov s dogs , we can become conditioned to associate environmental cues with rewards. Innocent enough when the sight of your sneakers makes you want to go for a run, but not necessarily so when the sight of the liquor store prompts you to want a drink. Indeed, Pavlovian cues that predict alcohol can lead us toward addiction. And sometimes those cues can become desirable in and of themselves, as shown in a new study by Concordia researchers, published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience .  Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues,  says Nadia Chaudhri , the study s lead author and professor in the Department of Psychology .  Conditioned reactions to those cues can trigger behaviours that result in drinking, like turning into the SAQ or reaching for a beer.  The results of the study suggest that cues that predict alcohol can become highly desirable; therefore, people may keep drinking because of the pleasure derived from our interactions with them. According to this research, drinkers wishing to make a change in their habits shouldn t just focus on the booze itself, but on all the factors that surround alcohol consumption.  Many people have specialized glassware for different kinds of drinks, and strong preferences for what they drink,  Chaudhri explains.  These preferences could be driven by the sensory properties of alcohol, like its taste, smell and how it looks. It is important for people to realize that drinking alcohol is a complex behaviour, and in addition to what alcohol does to our brains, it also plays a role in regulating our behaviours.  For the study, Chaudhri and her co-authors, former Concordia student Chandra Srey and postdoctoral researcher Jean-Marie Maddux , worked with 25 lab rats who were conditioned to associated a specific cue with the presence of ethanol   the main kind of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks. The researchers paired a visual cue with the ethanol so that rats would come to expect alcohol every time they saw that cue. Eventually, when the cue was presented, rats approached the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. But after a time they stopped performing this behaviour and instead began approaching and interacting with the cue. This happened even though the rats gained nothing by playing with the cue, and would actually have been better served by approaching the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. The researchers also noted that the rats would work to earn presentations of a cue that was previously paired with alcohol, even when alcohol was not dispensed along with that cue. These results suggest that a cue that predicts alcohol can become highly desireable. So how can rat behaviour help explain human addiction?  Lots of our behaviours are governed by fundamental learning mechanisms that are also present in other animal species,  says Chaudhri.  By modelling these behaviours in rats we can better understand the factors that control how these behaviours are acquired and maintained in humans.  She explains that we can use animal models to figure out ways to minimize unwanted behaviours like responding to cues that predict alcohol.  This knowledge can then be brought back to the clinic, where we can test similar strategies in humans,  says Chaudhri.  Rat models can also be used to inform us of the brain mechanisms that are important for behaviour. These basic science studies provide a critical foundation for the development of treatments for disorders like alcohol abuse and addiction.  Chaudhri will soon present the results of this and other related studies at the upcoming Society for Quantitative Analyses of Behavior annual symposium taking place May 27 to 28 in Chicago.

On May 19, the third annual PERFORM Centre Research Conference focuses on prevention and health research Posted on May 16, 2016 | By: J. Latimer Bioimaging is a relevant public health topic, Karen Li says,  because it helps with early diagnosis.  If you think your weight divided by the square of your body height is a reliable indication of your overall health and fitness, think again.  The bathroom scale and your BMI (body mass index) aren t accurate enough because they don t differentiate between somebody with muscle mass and someone with body fat,  says paediatrician Wei Shen, an associate director at the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center at Columbia University. Shen is one of six speakers at the third annual PERFORM Centre Research Conference at Concordia on Thursday, May 19. This year s theme is  Bioimaging for Prevention and Health Research,  and will include presentations on brain imaging, body composition, medical and musculoskeletal imaging. Why bioimaging?  The timing is right for this topic because of significant developments at PERFORM this year,  says  Karen Li , chair of the PERFORM Centre s Scientific Events and Communications Committee and a professor in the Department of Psychology .  Our imaging suite recently opened, and we recently welcomed Habib Benali, PERFORM s new associate scientific director of biomedical engineering. It s quite a coup for Concordia to have Professor Benali here given his international reputation.  At the conference, Benali and PERFORM research member Jean-Paul Soucy will be showcasing current imaging projects led by PERFORM members. The conference's international list of guest speakers  includes: Pedro Antonio Valdes-Sosa from Cuba, Kirsi A. Virtanen from Finland, Alan Evans from Montreal, Julie Hides from Australia, Timothy J. Hall and Shen from the USA.  Their lectures will cover a wide range of subjects because bioimaging has such a diverse application. We have someone talking about elite athletes and astronauts, someone talking about neuro-degeneration and another talking about image-based biomarkers,  says Li. Bioimaging and obesity research Bioimaging is a relevant public health topic, Li says,  because it helps with early diagnosis.  Which brings us back to Shen s research on obesity.  Recent advances in MRI and MRS made it possible to quantify total body and regional fat, to map fat tissue distribution and to evaluate fat in places like the liver and pancreas,  she explains.  The digitalization and centralization of these images allowed for clarifying obesity-related questions in various diseases. Imaging offers enormous opportunities in obesity care and prevention in diseases.  New methodology workshop On Friday, May 20, the day after the bioimaging conference, the PERFORM Centre will host its first Methodological Workshop in Imaging at Concordia s Loyola Campus, with a theme of  Longitudinal Analysis with Neuroimaging Data.  The workshop provides an opportunity to learn new methods special to longitudinal neuroimaging studies. There will be a series of five talks from experts who will introduce longitudinal studies involving different neuroimaging modalities (MRI, fMRI, PET, EEG), while focusing on specific methods to analyse that data. Good prognosis To date, more than 200 people are registered to attend the annual conference and learn more about how bioimaging can serve preventive healthcare. Will they be comparing their BMIs? Not likely. The third annual PERFORM Centre Research Conference begins at 7:45 a.m. on Thursday, May 19. The Methodological Workshop in Imaging begins at 9 a.m. on Friday, May 20. Online registration for both events is closed, but it is still possible to register on site.   ", "title": "What can bioimaging tell us about the bodies of athletes, astronauts and ourselves?

Graham Carr, Vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies, says Bherer has made truly exceptional contributions to Concordia.  He has really put his imprint on PERFORM as a centre for innovation and collaboration in the field of prevention and healthy lifestyle, which is one the most dynamic areas of health research and training.  The new opportunity he is pursuing speaks to the world-class quality of his personal research program  and to the respect that Concordia is earning as an important and unique contributor to the field of medical research in Montreal,  As the inaugural PERFORM chair and scientific director, Louis s vision, energy, appetite for collaboration and ambition for success have put the centre on the map. His tireless work has enabled us to recruit outstanding faculty of international quality, attract top-quality students and postdocs and emerge as an important new partner in the Quebec and Canadian landscape of health research.  I am proud of and grateful for everything that Louis has given to Concordia. He is a true leader. I know I am not alone in being sad at his decision to move over the mountain, but I am very eager to pursue new collaborations as he embarks on the next phase of his astonishing career.  For his part, Bherer is proud of what the PERFORM research team has been able to accomplish over the last four years.  We ve laid the foundation for our mission of advancing research, education and community engagement while offering unique opportunities for new discoveries in preventive health research,  he says.  With the support and guidance of the exceptional team of researchers, students and staff we have established, PERFORM will continue to blossom in the years to come.  Looking forward, Carr is extremely pleased that PERFORM will be in safe hands under the leadership of Habib Benali, given the scope of his international research and administrative portfolio, his extraordinary connections with the health research community in Montr al and his commitment to the institutional vision for PERFORM.  We are unbelievably fortunate that a person of Habib s calibre and experience is poised to accept the interim scientific director position,  says Carr.  As an engineer who also has deep connections in the Faculty of Arts and Science, he will continue to advance PERFORM s role in fostering interdisciplinary research and training collaborations between numerous departments and faculties, as well as with our many inter-institutional research networks.  Benali s research examines how multimodal imaging and computational modelling can be used to better understand which factors promote a healthy lifestyle. The internationally renowned scientist from Paris, who has received multiple distinctions and research awards, brings a wealth of leadership experience to the position. Prior to joining Concordia earlier this year, he served as co-director of the International Laboratory of Neuroimaging and Modelling (LlNeM), a collaboration of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (lNSERM), Universit  Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC, part of the Sorbonne Universities) and Universit  de Montr al. Benali was the head of the Laboratory of Functional Imaging (INSERM U678 unit, France) until 2013, and served as the deputy director of the 110-member Biomedical Imaging Laboratory U1146, INSERM   part of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and UPMC University   until 2015. He looks forward to his new leadership role at Concordia. \"My goal is to develop strong relationships with other research teams generating and fostering preventive health research, and research engineering teams, in particular, on the regional, national and international scene,  he says.  I hope to provide the scientific direction to make the PERFORM Centre a world leader in research, education and community involvement for better health.  Carr says that the leadership team at the centre, which also includes Jean-Paul Soucy, PERFORM associate director of bio-imaging and a professor at McGill University, an outstanding professional staff, and a strong team of department chairs and research scientists who help to execute the vision for PERFORM, will continue to have Concordia s full support as they work to increase the visibility and impact of preventive and healthy lifestyle research.

At what age can children explain people s behaviours as being guided by their mental states? Who do toddlers trust to teach them new things   and why? These questions, and others like it, have been the focus of Diane Poulin-Dubois  s research for the last 31 years at Concordia. The psychology professor from the Faculty of Arts and Science leads the Cognitive and Language Development Lab . On October 18, Poulin-Dubois is being honoured with a career award   the Prix Acfas Th r se Gouin-D carie for social science. The Association francophone pour le savoir (Acfas) hosts the largest multidisciplinary gatherings of research and knowledge in the French-speaking world.  Professor Diane Poulin-Dubois s groundbreaking scholarship in early cognitive and language development is widely esteemed by peers and practitioners,  says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies at Concordia.  We are delighted to see her receive such prestigious recognition from Acfas for the impact she has made within and beyond academe, nationally and internationally.  This isn t the first time that Acfas has recognized Poulin-Dubois s contributions. In 1996, she won the Prix du meilleur article de vulgarisation scientifique de l ACFAS (faculty award). She was also on the organizing committee when Concordia hosted the 2014 Acfas conference ,  Research: Zones of Creativity and Convergence,   welcoming 5,100 scholars and offering 173 colloquia.

A mentor feels  resurrected   Winning this award has a special sentimental value for me because it was recently renamed after my mentor, Th r se Gouin-D carie,  says Poulin-Dubois.  She is now retired but we talk frequently. She joked that my win has been like a resurrection for her.  This career award has also been gratifying for Poulin-Dubois, who is donating a portion of her $5,000 Acfas prize money to La Fondation du Dr. Julien which provides support to underprivileged children.  We work hard and this is recognition for what we do.  Just last year, her team published a study that proves that toddlers who learned more doublets (for example,  dog/chien ) over a seven-month period were ahead of the monolingual toddlers in executive function. This relates to skills such as planning, inhibition control and self-regulation. Her other recent work is in a relatively new field of social cognition called  trust,  which is the study of how children detect who to believe when acquiring new information.  We already know that preschoolers are more likely to learn from individuals with a history of making accurate claims over individuals who have been inaccurate or ignorant,  says Poulin-Dubois.  My particular contribution and insight is determining the origin of this ability. Which characteristics of the model are they sensitive to?

Praise from the department William Bukowski , psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Centre for Research in Human Development , is thrilled that Acfas is recognizing Poulin-Dubois.  Diane has been at the forefront of understanding how the concepts that were popular in a Piagetian perspective can now be applied to other domains of functioning, such as bilingualism,  he says.   She is remarkable in her capacity to develop rigorous and very creative laboratory tests.  Bukowski also points to Poulin-Dubois s success as a supervisor. Two of her graduate students, Cristina Crivello and Sabrina Chiarella, have won Graduate Research Communicator of the Year Awards for their papers on the benefits of bilingualism and early trust.

Concordia research associate Nuria de Zavalia explains how Daylight Saving Time affects our circadian rhythms, and how you can lessen the impact Posted on November 4, 2016 | By: J. Latimer  The extra hour of sleep sounds great, but when we change the time, there's an alteration of the circadian rhythms and that's when the problems start.  | Photo by Woodleywonderworks (Flickr CC) Is everyone ready to get an extra hour of sleep this weekend? At 2 a.m. this Sunday morning, November 6, we will return to standard time by moving our clocks back one hour. This change happens annually on the first Sunday in November   unless you live in most of Saskatchewan, Southampton Island in Nunavut or small pockets of Northwestern Ontario, Quebec or BC. These regions of Canada never opted into Daylight Saving Time (DST), although other cities and regions were using DST as early as 1918. Spring forward, fall back  The extra hour of sleep sounds great, but when we change the time, there's an alteration of the circadian rhythms and that's when the problems start,  says Nuria de Zavalia, a research associate who works with Shimon Amir , a psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia. It's like jet lag, she adds, explaining that alterations in the circadian system can affect alertness, mood, stress hormone levels, memory formation, cognitive performance, metabolism, cardiovascular system and, especially, depression.  Daylight Saving Time does not help people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder , for example,  says de Zavalia.  And research has shown that the Monday after the time change   especially in the spring, when we have one hour less sleep   there is an increase in car accidents, heart attacks and depressive episodes .  So, what can be done to lessen the effects of returning to standard time?  Start early,  says de Zavalia.  If you can change the clocks a few days early, in 10-minute increments instead of a full hour in one shot, it ll be easier on your system.

Following a successful inaugural season, Beyond Disciplines is back for another year of interdisciplinary discussion and exploration. The public series, created by the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS), examines issues of the day through a variety of perspectives. In 2015 16, topics included gene editing and CRISPR technology , storytelling in research and the future of diversity . The series also spawned a podcast , which is ongoing.  Last year really exceeded our expectations,  says Andr  Roy , dean of FAS.  So, naturally, we want to set the bar even higher.  On Thursday, October 20, the first Beyond Disciplines event of the season,   Come to your senses: Sensescapes in research and in life ,  invites the audience to experience a variety of sensory-themed presentations. Held in collaboration with Concordia s Centre for Sensory Studies, the evening will be hosted by centre co-director David Howes . According to Roy, this year s series won t follow the traditional format of a panel discussion and Q&A.  We really wanted to mix things up and start with something completely different.  Claudine Gauthier is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and one of the upcoming featured speakers. For her, the experience is a rare opportunity to exchange on a topic of research with people from very different fields, and share different perspectives with the public. Gauthier s presentation will discuss how the brain \"sees\" images and how this changes with age.  I will show Magnetic Resonance Imaging pictures of the brain in action during a task, and how we can learn about changes in brain function and aging from these images,  she explains.  Thinking outside the box  Fellow presenter Owen Chapman , associate professor in Communication Studies , will offer an audiovisual experience based on work developed in the Mobile Media Lab that he co-directs.  I will DJ/VJ a short set featuring remixing of both local and distant audio field recordings through an immersive 3D virtual soundscape platform,  says Chapman.  I hope to prompt users to think about the causes and effects of the sounds of one's everyday life.  Another first for Beyond Disciplines this year? Inviting people from outside FAS. Featured panellists in the  Come to your senses  event include Cynthia Hammond , Shauna Janssen and Rhona Richman Kenneally , all from the Faculty of Fine Arts .  I have been investigating the intersections between taste as a sense experience and taste as sanctioned design or style,  explains Richman Kenneally, a professor in the Department of Design and Computation Arts and a fellow in the School of Irish Studies .  I am really looking forward to participating in this event, since my academic training as well as my ongoing research are fundamentally grounded in transdisciplinarity across design and the humanities.  Roy says the series plans to continue thinking outside the box, and promises more surprises as the season unfolds.  We have always said we wanted to explore different forms and formats. As great as last year was, I am confident this one will be even better.

Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, October 7. The recognition comes at the perfect time: five days after 50.2 per cent of voters rejected  a peace agreement with FARC, the oldest and biggest guerrilla group in the world. Today, as a graduate student at Concordia, I can think over what this means for me, for my country and for my academic career. I grew up in an urban context, distant from the day-to-day armed conflict. However, as is true for all Colombians, I grew up knowing that my country was one of the most violent places in the world. That motivated me to conduct research oriented toward informing peace education. When applying to the PhD in Psychology Program at Concordia, I included in my statement of purpose an explanation about how this would be  a secure step toward contributing to knowledge about the healthy development of children in order to meliorate the reality of Colombia and other countries.  I had the fortune to be accepted into the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory directed by William Bukowski , who has a deep knowledge of Colombian culture and has conducted research there over the last decade. This allowed me to maintain contact with my country, as did the Concordia Graduate Student Mobility Award that I got in 2015. That award allowed me to conduct a summer practice in Colombia, and to contribute to the production of a national report on students  results on citizenship abilities and a document on peace education directed to parents. I have to confess that despite all my purpose as a researcher in training, I was skeptical about seeing the end of the war in Colombia before I died. My hopelessness diminished when it was announced that the government and FARC would sign an agreement of peace, but increased again when I saw that not only had Colombians chosen to decline the referendum but also that 63 per cent of Colombians did not take part in the democratic process.   On Friday morning, thanks to an email from Dr. Bukowski, I found out that Santos was awarded the Nobel Prize, and optimism came back to me. As a supporter of the current agreement, I think that this prize represents pressure on the actors to find a prompt solution. The government, the opposition and FARC leaders will have to find a way to renegotiate the aspects that still need to be revised. The prize committee in Oslo was clear that this recognition is a tool to support Santos and his team in their intention to end a war that has been going on for 50 years. I have to say that on the negative side, Colombians have a culture  of the moment.  We glorify and celebrate while we forget the actual challenges we have to face. The main challenge is to change the minds of thousands of my compatriots who did not treat the peace discussion as a serious topic. I do not mean the people who voted either yes or no in the referendum   I am referring to those who did not participate. But in the face of a deeply divided country, this news brings us hope again.

Long afternoons practising scales. All that time you spent in piano lessons and dance classes as a youngster may have seemed like a pain, but new research now confirms what your parents claimed: it s good for mind and body. In fact, a recent study published in NeuroImage by a team* of researchers from the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research, proves that dance and music training have even stronger effects on the brain than previously understood   but in markedly different ways. The researchers used high-tech imaging techniques to compare the effects of dance and music training on the white matter structure of experts in these two disciplines. They then examined the relationship between training-induced brain changes and dance and music abilities.  We found that dancers and musicians differed in many white matter regions, including sensory and motor pathways, both at the primary and higher cognitive levels of processing,  says Chiara Giacosa, PhD candidate in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and the study s lead author. In particular, dancers showed broader connections of fibre bundles linking the sensory and motor brain regions themselves, as well as broader fibre bundles connecting the brain s two hemispheres   in the regions that process sensory and motor information. In contrast, musicians had stronger and more coherent fibre bundles in those same pathways.  This suggests that dance and music training affect the brain in opposite directions, increasing global connectivity and crossing of fibres in dance training, and strengthening specific pathways in music training,  Giacosa explains.  Indeed, while dancers train their whole body, which has a broader representation in the neural cortex, musicians focus their training on some specific body parts, such as hands, fingers or the mouth, which have a smaller cortical representation in the brain.   This work has major potential  Interestingly, dancers and musicians differed more between each other than in comparison to the group of control subjects who had no extensive formal training in either field. According to Giacosa, this can happen because a range of uncontrolled variables influenced the control subjects in different ways, making them more similar to one group or the other.  Contrary to that, our samples of dancers and musicians were specifically selected to be pure groups of experts, which makes it easier to differentiate between them.  Virginia Penhune , professor in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and chair of its Department of Psychology , is the study s senior author. She notes that this research deepens the current knowledge about how regions of the brain are connected in networks, and how these structural networks change with training.  This work has major potential for being applied to the fields of education and rehabilitation,  Penhune says.  Understanding how dance and music training differently affect brain networks will allow us to selectively use them to enhance their functioning or compensate for difficulties and diseases that involve those specific brain networks.  Some studies have already shown how music training at a young age can improve various cognitive skills, but dance has yet to be used in a similar way.  Recent research has started to show some improvements with dance and music therapy in patients affected by Parkinson s disease and children with autism respectively, but much more can be done with these and other diseases,  says Penhune. *Partners in research: The co-authors of this study   Chiara Giacosa, Falisha J. Karpati, Nicholas E.V. Foster, Virginia Penhune, and principal investigator Krista L. Hyde   are all members of the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research.

What's more, Psychology BSc students may complete a Specialization or Honours in  Behavioural Neuroscience .  BA or BSc? What is the difference between a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and a Bachelor of Science (BSc)? Most students will have to complete 90 credits to earn a Bachelor's degree at Concordia. Most courses are worth three or six credits. Therefore, to complete a Bachelor's degree one would have to complete the equivalent of 30, three credit courses. If you are a student majoring in Psychology, many of your courses will be in Psychology and others (electives) will be taken in other departments (for example, Math, English, Sociology etc.). The number of Psychology credits that you have to take depends on whether you are in the Major, Specialization or Honours stream. In terms of your Psychology courses, there is no difference between the BA degree and the BSc. The difference comes in the electives. Science students will select a number of their electives from the sciences (Biology, Chemistry, and Physics) while Arts student will select primarily from the arts and humanities.

The Major consists of 42 credits in Psychology and is relevant for someone seeking a good general degree which could have applications in a variety of fields related to teaching, business, personnel, or community involvement. The Specialization consists of 60 credits in Psychology and as a more concentrated program is appropriate for someone with career plans in an area involving Psychology. It can prepare students for employment in such areas as those listed above for the Major but is recognized as a more intensive degree. Depending on the selection of courses the Specialization may also provide a background for graduate work such as a Master s degree in counselling Psychology, or social work, or even in an MBA program. The Honours degree is the most intensive of all consisting of 66 credits of Psychology and including two Honours seminars and an Honours thesis in the last year. At least partly because of these courses this program gives the best preparation for admission to graduate school.

What are my options? Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about admission to our graduate program in Clinical Psychology Q. I primarily want to be a Clinical Psychologist. What are the other local opportunities to develop the type of career that I want? A. There are many different graduate programs that allow one to have a career as a psychologist or therapist. Some local universities offer a Psy.D. in Psychology (e.g. psy.umontreal.ca/programmes- et- cours/cycles- superieurs/doctorat en- psychologie clinique/ ). This is a doctoral degree in Psychology that does not require the research component of a Ph.D. thesis. Other graduate programs include Counselling Psychology (e.g. www.mcgill.ca/edu ecp/), and Art, Drama or Music Therapy (e.g. creativeartstherapies.concordia.ca/ ). Different programs may or may not have the strict research pre- requisites and heavy research component that are required for an M.A./Ph.D. Program in Clinical Psychology. Q. What are my chances of being accepted into the graduate  Research and Clinical Training Option  in Psychology at Concordia? A. Although we receive hundreds of applications from highly qualified honours students, we are only able to accept 11 new clinical students each year. Students that do not have a conventional honours undergraduate degree in psychology or its equivalent, or who have not completed an empirical research thesis as part of their undergraduate studies, can sometimes be at a further disadvantage. Q. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist, but I don t have an undergraduate degree in Psychology. What are my options? A. Due to our accreditation from the CPA and APA, we require certain pre-requisite psychology course competencies prior to entrance into the graduate program. You can enrol in a university undergraduate psychology program and complete these courses   as listed in our honours degree equivalency checklist. If you already have a BA or BSc degree, you do not need to complete a second degree in psychology, merely the pre-requisite courses. Q. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but it isn t an honours degree. What are my options? A. This presents a little more of a problem. If you already have an undergraduate degree in psychology, you cannot enrol in a second undergraduate psychology degree program. You can enrol as an independent student in some cases, but many universities, including Concordia, restrict the higher level psychology courses to psychology majors. Thus, you may not have access to the courses you need when enrolled as an independent student. Some universities, including McGill, offer a special status student program to make up for any course deficiencies for graduate school ( www.psych.mcgill.ca/grad/program/application_admission.htm ). At the present time, Concordia does not have a qualifying program for this purpose. Q. I want to be a Clinical Psychologist. I have a Psychology degree, but my grades are below what is required (minimum GPA of 3.5/4.3). What are my options? A. Grades aren t the only factor taken into account when considering an applicant for graduate school. For example research experience is weighed very heavily. However, this particular program is very competitive and the odds of someone with a low GPA being accepted into the clinical program are very low. Some students feel that taking a few more courses and getting better grades will help. Usually a few courses will not have a great impact on the overall GPA and all courses are weighted equally during our admissions process. Q. I don t have an Honours Psychology degree, but I have lots of work experience in counselling and/or therapy. Can my work experience be considered for my application instead of university courses or research experience? A. Our graduate program is heavily based upon the research-practitioner model. It is assumed that counselling/therapy skills will be taught once in the program so they are not a pre-requisite for entry into the program. Thus, pre-requisite coursework and research experience are considered most important for our admissions process and prior counselling experience cannot replace those. Q. If I apply to the graduate Psychology Program (Research Option) and I am accepted to that program, can I later switch to the Research and Clinical Option? A. No. If a student is accepted into the graduate program,  Research Option  they are not eligible to later apply to the  Research and Clinical Training Option .

{"url": "https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/students/undergraduate/appointments-academic-advisors.html", "body": "Honours Am I on track to graduate? In order to graduate, you are required to complete a specific number of Psychology credits and outside electives. Outside electives are courses offered in other programs outside of Psychology. You also must ensure you have completed any missing profile courses. To check your progress in our program, and track to make sure you are going to be able to graduate, use the program check sheets here: https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/students/undergraduate/monitoring-academic-progress.html If you are still uncertain after having completed the program check sheet, you can make an appointment to see an academic advisor. Always bring the completed checklist with you when seeing an academic advisor When will I finish my degree? This depends on your degree, the number of credits you need to graduate (90, 108, 120), the number of credits taken per semester, and if you also take summer courses. For example, if you are a full-time student taking 12 credits per semester, you can complete 90 credits in 4 years. If you take 15 credits per semester, it will take you three years to complete 90 credits. How many credits do I need to do per semester? To be a full-time student in Quebec, you must take a minimum of 12 credits per semester (usually 4 courses). The maximum load is 15 credits per semester (usually 5 courses). If you are worried about the workload that university courses require, we recommend you start out with 12 credits (i.e., 4 courses) in the first semester. If you can handle the workload, then go to 15 credits in subsequent semesters. If you are thinking of applying to Medicine, Law, or Graduate Degrees, then please check with the schools you plan to apply to for the degree requirements (some schools expect you to take a 15-credit to demonstrate that you can handle the workload). Should I take 4-5 Psychology Courses per semester? Psychology courses tend to demand more work from the student than other general elective courses. This is especially the case for courses that have a laboratory component (i.e., PSYC310, PSYC315, PSYC311, PSYC316). While it is possible to take a full Psychology course load per semester, it is not recommended. Instead, taking 2-3 psychology courses, in addition to 1-2 general electives is recommended. For the summer semester, how many courses should I take? Given the shorter more compact nature of the summer courses, we recommend taking no more than 6 credits (i.e., two courses) per summer term. Students wishing to receive financial aid during the summer are required to undertake 12 credits during the two summer terms. Should I drop a course? Students will sometimes think they should stay in a course even though they are doing poorly, as they have heard that a DISC looks bad on their transcript. It is ok to have a DISC on your transcript   this happens from time to time as students like the initial idea of a course, but find it different when taking it.  Also, as DISC is better than receiving an F for a course, as a poor grade affects your GPA (a DISC does not count towards your GPA). However, try to not make a habit of having too many DISCs. Do I need to meet with an advisor to repeat a course? Students can repeat a course at any point, without making an advising appointment. The exception is if you are trying to repeat a course which is a prerequisite for another course you are or have taken. Students should think of the following before repeating a course: 1)  While re-taking a course can improve your GPA this will only happen if you do better than you did the first time. If you end up with a lower grade in the re-take, then this will lower your GPA. The last taken grade is what counts towards the GPA. 2)  The earlier grade will remain on your transcript, and will not disappear. 3)  How have things changes since the first time you took the course? Have you improved your work load or study habits to give yourself a better opportunity for improving your grade? How many courses / what grades do I need to raise my GPA? This is a common question from students that are either attempting to graduate, are thinking of applying to graduate school, or are in academic jeopardy (e.g., conditional standing, failed standing) the best way to answer this question is to try out different course and grade scenarios to see how these may impact your GPA. We have made available a simple excel spreadsheet for this purpose (download link here).   QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO SPECIALIZATION STUDENTS WHO WANT TO TAKE THE OPTIONAL RESEARCH EXPERIENCE COURSE (PSYC 485) When do I take the required PSYC311 and PSYC316 courses? You must complete these two courses BEFORE you can get permission to register for PSYC 485. You will not be able to do PSYC 311 or PSYC 316 concurrently with PSYC 485. Keep in mind that PSYC 485 is a full year course, so PSYC 311 and PSYC 316 must be completed the year prior (usually in your second year). Also be aware that neither of these courses is offered during the summer. It is best to complete PSYC 316 and PSYC 311 (in that sequence) in separate semesters, as they both carry a heavy workload. When do I take PSYC 485? PSYC 485 is an optional course for students in the specialization program who wish to have the opportunity to conduct research. You would apply to take this course in the summer before your final year after you have received your grades from the winter term. You must have a minumim GPA of 3.0, and a thesis supervisor to be admitted. A completed application form and a 'supervisor-student-contract' (both available on the department website in the FORMS section) must be submitted with your application. How do I find a thesis supervisor? It is your responsibility to contact faculty members, and ask if they would be willing to act as your thesis supervisor. Not all faculty members take on a student each year and those that do take on a limited number. Prior to contacting a faculty member, students should consult the faculty profiles on the department website to find a research area that interests them. Be aware that there are a limited number of spots so register early! QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO HONOURS. When do I take the required PSYC311 and PSYC316 courses? You must complete these two courses BEFORE you can get permission to register for PSYC 495. You will not be able to do PSYC 311 or PSYC 316 concurrently with PSYC 495. Keep in mind that PSYC 495 is a full year course, so PSYC 311 and PSYC 316 must be completed the year prior (usually in your second year). Also be aware that neither of these courses is offered during the summer. It is best to complete PSYC 316 and PSYC 311 (in that sequence) in separate semesters, as they both carry a heavy workload. When do I take PSYC 490, 491, and 495? The Honours Seminars (PSYC 490, 491) and Honours Thesis Seminar (PSYC495) are taken in the final year of the honours program. To be able to register for these classes, you must have completed PSYC 311 and get permission from the department, which will be given once you have a confirmed thesis supervisor. You would take these courses in your final year provided your grades warrant your completing the honours program (have and maintain a minimum 3.5 cumulative GPA in PSYC courses, and 3.3 in all others). How do I find a thesis supervisor? It is your responsibility to contact faculty members, and ask if they would be willing to act as your thesis supervisor. Not all faculty members take on a student each year and those that do take on a limited number. Prior to contacting a faculty member, students should consult the faculty profiles on the department website to find a research area that interests them.  How do I secure a place in PSYC 491, 492, and 495? The honours advisor will open a place for you in a particular section after you let the advisor know, by email, which faculty member has agreed to be your research thesis supervisor, and the thesis supervisor confirms by email that you are accepted into the laboratory. If you are an Honours student, you do not have to complete the 'supervisor-student-contract' at this point (available on the department website in the FORMS section), as you will do so during the first week of the thesis class. Who can register me? You register yourself once a place has been opened for you. You will receive an email, after registration begins, listing the specific sections to which you have been admitted. Can I pick a thesis / seminar section? No. Students are assigned to a thesis / seminar section by the honours advisor. This procedure provides an even distribution of the number of thesis students and research topics across all sections. What if I don t yet have confirmation of a place in the honours courses when my date for registration occurs? All the seminar and thesis courses occur at the same time (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 16:15 pm to 18:45). With that schedule in mind, you can register for all your other courses when your date for registration occurs.

March 23, 2017, 12 p.m.   2 p.m. Any time students and professors are engaging with the community on a project, there are many different power dynamics at work. When it comes to more technical or specialized knowledge, the degrees and prestige granted by one s association with a university makes the expert/non-expert dynamic even more pronounced.  Recognizing that, in the interest of mutually beneficial partnerships where the learning flows in all directions, it is important to take steps to breakdown these hierarchies, this community of practice event invites participants to consider what it would take to meaningfully level the playing field. By recognizing the presence and the impact of the academic gaze, what steps can we take to address it?  What participatory practices might enable us to value and integrate less formalized ways of knowing and non-academic expertise? What would change if we modeled these same practices in our classroom? How can we best support our students as they learn to work more collaboratively with their community partners and each other? Together, we will explore what it means to take democracy seriously in space and time. As professors and urban practitioners, how can we become facilitators rather than leaders?

This workshop will cover topics such as how elections are run in Canada (and how they can be improved); youth electoral disengagement (and what can be done about it); drawing electoral boundaries (and the meaning of effective representation); transparency in electoral financing (and why this is so important in democracies). We ll also discuss whether our current method of running elections, and of voting, are outdated, and whether major changes are (or should be) forthcoming. Go beyond the basics and dig deeper into economic, political, and procedural underpinnings of elections. Also, what kind of electoral reform is under consideration at the federal and provincial levels in Canada, and what are the prospects for reform?

Concordia research associate Nuria de Zavalia explains how Daylight Saving Time affects our circadian rhythms, and how you can lessen the impact Posted on November 4, 2016 | By: J. Latimer  The extra hour of sleep sounds great, but when we change the time, there's an alteration of the circadian rhythms and that's when the problems start.  | Photo by Woodleywonderworks (Flickr CC) Is everyone ready to get an extra hour of sleep this weekend? At 2 a.m. this Sunday morning, November 6, we will return to standard time by moving our clocks back one hour. This change happens annually on the first Sunday in November   unless you live in most of Saskatchewan, Southampton Island in Nunavut or small pockets of Northwestern Ontario, Quebec or BC. These regions of Canada never opted into Daylight Saving Time (DST), although other cities and regions were using DST as early as 1918. Spring forward, fall back  The extra hour of sleep sounds great, but when we change the time, there's an alteration of the circadian rhythms and that's when the problems start,  says Nuria de Zavalia, a research associate who works with Shimon Amir , a psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia. It's like jet lag, she adds, explaining that alterations in the circadian system can affect alertness, mood, stress hormone levels, memory formation, cognitive performance, metabolism, cardiovascular system and, especially, depression.  Daylight Saving Time does not help people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder , for example,  says de Zavalia.  And research has shown that the Monday after the time change   especially in the spring, when we have one hour less sleep   there is an increase in car accidents, heart attacks and depressive episodes .  So, what can be done to lessen the effects of returning to standard time?  Start early,  says de Zavalia.  If you can change the clocks a few days early, in 10-minute increments instead of a full hour in one shot, it ll be easier on your system.

I want to know what people are up to,  says Nisi Sinzinkayo, a Moncton, N.B., transplant. For her, Concordia s Department of Psychology was a natural fit. As Sinzinkayo says:  I see this as a way to understand people even more.  Department of Psychology student Nisi Sinzinkayo Before taking the plunge and moving to Montreal for her undergraduate studies, Sinzinkayo had developed a strong opinion of both Concordia and Montreal.  I visited the city and have friends who attended Concordia,  says Sinzinkayo.  I like how open-minded people are here. People don t judge you.  One hurdle for Sinzinkayo is the costs that come with studying.  Coming out of province, tuition is automatically more expensive,  says Sinzinkayo. Add to that, she notes that there are living expenses such as rent and public transit. Sinzinkayo received the Leonard and Bina Ellen Entrance Bursary her first year of study in 2014.  That was a great email to receive,  says Sinzinkayo, who entered the university as a teenager directly from high school.  I have siblings, so I think of all the things my parents help pay for. The bursary was welcome news for all of us,  she says. Sinzinkayo already has long-term career ambitions.   If I could continue going with psychology, that would be great,  says Sinzinkayo.  I would like to complete a PhD.   Psychology is a good foundational education. As a  plan B  I would want to go into marketing.  Sinzinkayo expects to finish her bachelor s degree by 2018. #CUgiving Read more inspiring stories like this one in Momentum, Concordia's Donor and Student Awards newsletter.

Take the test The free rapid-HIV testing is happening both days from 12 to 4 p.m. in Room 711, on the Sir George Williams Campus. It's sponsored in part by Clinical Projects Grant from the Ordre r gional des infirmi res et infirmiers de Montr al/Laval, as well the CSU Special Projects fund. The CSU, Queer Concordia , Health Services and the Concordia Undergraduate Psychology Association (CUPA) are collaborating to run the testing events. To choose from a variety of free condoms at the give-away, simply go to the Atrium of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) on the Sir George Williams Campus. You can always get free condoms at the weekly Healthy YOU at CU information table, or come by Health Services Condom Boutique where you can choose from a variety of condoms, \"3-for-$1\"!  The goal is to remind students that regular STI testing is a normal part of taking care of your health, just like going to the dentist,  says Gabriella Szabo, health promotion specialist with  Health Services .  And students get their results in 20 minutes, rather than 10 days.  Be informed and empowered December 1 is World Aids Day and a perfect occasion to have a clear-headed conversation about sexually transmitted infections (STIs). CATIE , a Canadian online source for information and resources about HIV and AIDS, is a good place to learn more about the history and contemporary reality of the disease. The Concordia University Community Lecture Series on HIV/AIDS has its fourth event on December 1 from 6:45 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the Museum of Fine Arts. London artist Conal McStravick will discuss the impact of the AIDS crisis on art and parallel queer activist movements at the event, entitled Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism, and the AIDS Crisis: Learning in a Public Medium. Consent is essential to practicing safer sex. Last February, the two-day student organized fair, called  Sexpress Yourself , helped propel the dialogue on campus about safe and consensual sex with similar events. At the time, Jennifer Drummond, coordinator of the Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC) explained:  We want to reach as many students as we can and make sure they know about our support services and activities,  she says.

Profiles of Clinical Faculty LUCIE BONNEVILLE My clinical interests are in several areas such as depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety and psychotic symptoms.  My orientation is eclectic.  In general, I use techniques from the models of Humanistic, Psychodynamic, Existential and Cognitive therapies in short and long term psychotherapy with adults and late adolescence. SAM BURSTEIN, Clinical Psychologist at the Montreal Children s Hospital and in private practice.  My clinical experience lies mainly in the area of working with children and their families, wherein the presenting concern is child-related. Conceptualization and intervention directed at the family level stem from the belief that the family system is usually the most relevant and powerful in an individual's life.  Although a family system approach does not preclude working with an individual child/adolescent, it does assume that change in the client will have an important impact on other family members. Within the area of individual work, my bias is toward a cognitive-behavioral approach.  MARK ELLENBOGEN, Director of Practica and Chair of CUPIP,  CRDH  Member,  Research Interests My therapeutic orientation is predominantly based on the principles of cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy. My clinical approach is to use empirically supported treatments that are tailored to fit the needs of individual clients.  My clinical interests include diagnostic assessment and individual psychotherapy, in adult and adolescent populations with major affective disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and eating disorders. DINA GIANNOPOULOS,  APC  Administrative Director My clinical interests are in the areas of depression and anxiety disorders.  I supervise students who are interested in conducting cognitive-behaviour therapy with adults.  Emphasis is placed on empirically validated cognitive-behaviour therapy techniques.  The client-therapist relationship is also examined in supervision. JENNIFER MCGRATH,  Research Interests My therapeutic orientation is fundamentally guided by cognitive-behavioral principles and the use of empirically supported treatments while incorporating components of other orientations tailored to fit the needs of individual clients.  My clinical interests largely span the area of child health psychology to include Childhood Behavior Disorders, Developmental Disorders, Behavioral Medicine (Diabetes, Oncology/Cancer, Headache, Enuresis, Feeding/Eating Problems, Cardiovascular Disease, Sleep Disorders, Anxiety, Depression, Smoking Cessation, Medical Regimen Adherence, Coping with Chronic Illness, Coping with Stress), Psychoeducational Assessments, and Psychiatric Triage.  Students on my supervision team have the opportunity to learn how to conduct comprehensive psychoeducational assessments of children and adolescents as well as lead group therapy for parents and children with health related issues (e.g., sleep problems, smoking cessation, stress management). SYDNEY MILLER,  Research Interests I have two main areas of clinical interest which would be relevant for the subject populations likely to be seen at the clinic. In general, my therapeutic orientation in both these areas is cognitive behavioral. One area of interest is adult psychopathology involving a variety of problems including the anxiety disorders (e.g. agoraphobia, panic, social phobia, simple phobia), depression, couples with marital problems, assertiveness issues, and social skills training. Another area of interest is in adult health psychology. This involves the treatment of physical illness and related psychological problems. The type of clients who might be seen include individuals with weight problems, headaches, high blood pressure, back pain and insomnia. ROISIN O'CONNOR  Research Interests My clinical interests include the assessment and treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders as the single presenting concern for adolescents and adults, or when co-morbid with substance use (i.e., alcohol use) concerns/disorders.  I am also interested in the assessment and treatment of pathological gambling.  I approach my clinical work as a scientist-practitioner. Accordingly, I draw on cognitive-behavioural therapy and other empirically supported treatments. I emphasize the use of theory-grounded case conceptualizations, hypothesis testing, and on-going data collection throughout treatment.  Some of the intervention strategies I use are skills training, cue exposure, response prevention, behavioural experiments, and cognitive reevaluations.  As well, I support the use of motivational interviewing techniques. VIRGINIA PENHUNE,  CRDH  Member  Research Interests The practicum in Neuropsychology is designed to teach students the fundamentals of neuropsychological assessment and to prepare them for external practica and internships in Neuropsychology or in domains that require familiarity with cognitive and neuropsychological assessment.  The practicum will include a didactic and training period, covering basic theoretical issues in Neuropsychology as well as, test administration and scoring, clinical interview and report writing, as well as review of common medical tests relevant for neurological populations (i.e., MRI, CT, EEG).  During this time, students will practice tests with other students and with at least one normal volunteer.  One practice testing session will be videotaped and reviewed with the supervisor. After satisfactorily completing the practice testing, students will go on to test 2-3 consecutive clinical patients over course of the year.  This will include reviewing the neuropsychological and neurological literature relevant to the particular disorder, putting together an appropriate battery of tests for each patient, administering the tests and writing a complete neuropsychological test report.

ADAM RADOMSKY  Research Interests My main areas of clinical interest are the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders and related problems in adults. I use a cognitive-behavioural approach and support the use of this and other empirically validated treatments identified by the Canadian and American Psychological Associations. The practicum emphasizes the application of cognitive-behavioural models and methods, including: the development of a collaborative relationship, self-monitoring, exposure (both imaginal and in vivo), response prevention, relaxation techniques, behavioural experiments, hypothesis testing, cognitive/belief investigations, habit reversal, evaluation of treatment gains and relapse prevention. These and other strategies will be applied to a variety of anxiety disorders and related problems.  ANDREW RYDER  Research Interests My therapeutic orientation is predominantly cognitive-behavioural, influenced by the existential perspective on the person and the ultimate goals of therapy, and by the interpersonal perspective at the level of moment-to-moment interactions between therapist and client. As a scientist-practitioner, I take an evidence-based approach, meaning that specific interventions are informed both by the published literature and by evidence obtained over the course of a specific case (e.g., assessments, mood diaries, observation). My clinical interests are assessment and treatment of anxiety, depression, and personality/interpersonal problems. LISA SERBIN, Director of Clinical Training, Member of  CRDH ,  Research Interests My research and clinical interests focus on developmental psychopathology and children's health. Specifically, I am interested in disorders of childhood, and in the environmental and social contexts in which children's development takes place. My clinical supervision focuses on the assessment and treatment of children referred for learning, emotional, social and behavioral problems. The focus is on the child, the family, and the environment (including daycare, school, and home settings). Assessment and treatment typically focus on the development of age-appropriate social and cognitive skills, as well as on emotional, behavioral and family problems, with treatment modality determined by the needs of the case. In recent years children have been seen under my supervision for problems including learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, behavior and attentional disorders, conduct disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. Students under my direction have learned to use cognitive-behavioral therapy, play therapy, crisis management, and family therapy approaches, and to integrate these diverse theoretical models in developing effective strategies for intervention. DALE STACK,  CRDH  Member,  Research Interests My clinical experience is in the area of assessment and treatment of difficulties that occur in children (and their families).   My particular focus is working with very young children (preschoolers) and their families.   This area encompasses a range of problems including (but not limited to) developmental delays, expressive and/or receptive language delays, pervasive developmental disorders, behavior problems, sensory and physical disabilities, adjustment difficulties, child management and parenting, and family issues.   My general approach is cognitive-behavioral.   I underscore the importance of comprehensive assessment and I utilize alternative assessment procedures when valuable (e.g., non-verbal, non-compliant, etc.,).   Given the age range of the children, my clinical work involves direct contact with the child and his/her parent(s)/caregivers (and family).

I supervise students who are interested in conducting cognitive-behaviour therapy with adults.  Emphasis is placed on empirically validated cognitive-behaviour therapy techniques.  The client-therapist relationship is also examined in supervision. JENNIFER MCGRATH,  Research Interests My therapeutic orientation is fundamentally guided by cognitive-behavioral principles and the use of empirically supported treatments while incorporating components of other orientations tailored to fit the needs of individual clients.  My clinical interests largely span the area of child health psychology to include Childhood Behavior Disorders, Developmental Disorders, Behavioral Medicine (Diabetes, Oncology/Cancer, Headache, Enuresis, Feeding/Eating Problems, Cardiovascular Disease, Sleep Disorders, Anxiety, Depression, Smoking Cessation, Medical Regimen Adherence, Coping with Chronic Illness, Coping with Stress), Psychoeducational Assessments, and Psychiatric Triage.  Students on my supervision team have the opportunity to learn how to conduct comprehensive psychoeducational assessments of children and adolescents as well as lead group therapy for parents and children with health related issues (e.g., sleep problems, smoking cessation, stress management). SYDNEY MILLER,  Research Interests I have two main areas of clinical interest which would be relevant for the subject populations likely to be seen at the clinic. In general, my therapeutic orientation in both these areas is cognitive behavioral. One area of interest is adult psychopathology involving a variety of problems including the anxiety disorders (e.g. agoraphobia, panic, social phobia, simple phobia), depression, couples with marital problems, assertiveness issues, and social skills training. Another area of interest is in adult health psychology. This involves the treatment of physical illness and related psychological problems. The type of clients who might be seen include individuals with weight problems, headaches, high blood pressure, back pain and insomnia. ROISIN O'CONNOR  Research Interests My clinical interests include the assessment and treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders as the single presenting concern for adolescents and adults, or when co-morbid with substance use (i.e., alcohol use) concerns/disorders.  I am also interested in the assessment and treatment of pathological gambling.  I approach my clinical work as a scientist-practitioner. Accordingly, I draw on cognitive-behavioural therapy and other empirically supported treatments. I emphasize the use of theory-grounded case conceptualizations, hypothesis testing, and on-going data collection throughout treatment.  Some of the intervention strategies I use are skills training, cue exposure, response prevention, behavioural experiments, and cognitive reevaluations.  As well, I support the use of motivational interviewing techniques. VIRGINIA PENHUNE,  CRDH  Member  Research Interests The practicum in Neuropsychology is designed to teach students the fundamentals of neuropsychological assessment and to prepare them for external practica and internships in Neuropsychology or in domains that require familiarity with cognitive and neuropsychological assessment.  The practicum will include a didactic and training period, covering basic theoretical issues in Neuropsychology as well as, test administration and scoring, clinical interview and report writing, as well as review of common medical tests relevant for neurological populations (i.e., MRI, CT, EEG).  During this time, students will practice tests with other students and with at least one normal volunteer.  One practice testing session will be videotaped and reviewed with the supervisor. After satisfactorily completing the practice testing, students will go on to test 2-3 consecutive clinical patients over course of the year.  This will include reviewing the neuropsychological and neurological literature relevant to the particular disorder, putting together an appropriate battery of tests for each patient, administering the tests and writing a complete neuropsychological test report.

ADAM RADOMSKY  Research Interests My main areas of clinical interest are the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders and related problems in adults. I use a cognitive-behavioural approach and support the use of this and other empirically validated treatments identified by the Canadian and American Psychological Associations. The practicum emphasizes the application of cognitive-behavioural models and methods, including: the development of a collaborative relationship, self-monitoring, exposure (both imaginal and in vivo), response prevention, relaxation techniques, behavioural experiments, hypothesis testing, cognitive/belief investigations, habit reversal, evaluation of treatment gains and relapse prevention. These and other strategies will be applied to a variety of anxiety disorders and related problems.  ANDREW RYDER  Research Interests My therapeutic orientation is predominantly cognitive-behavioural, influenced by the existential perspective on the person and the ultimate goals of therapy, and by the interpersonal perspective at the level of moment-to-moment interactions between therapist and client. As a scientist-practitioner, I take an evidence-based approach, meaning that specific interventions are informed both by the published literature and by evidence obtained over the course of a specific case (e.g., assessments, mood diaries, observation). My clinical interests are assessment and treatment of anxiety, depression, and personality/interpersonal problems. LISA SERBIN, Director of Clinical Training, Member of  CRDH ,  Research Interests My research and clinical interests focus on developmental psychopathology and children's health. Specifically, I am interested in disorders of childhood, and in the environmental and social contexts in which children's development takes place. My clinical supervision focuses on the assessment and treatment of children referred for learning, emotional, social and behavioral problems. The focus is on the child, the family, and the environment (including daycare, school, and home settings). Assessment and treatment typically focus on the development of age-appropriate social and cognitive skills, as well as on emotional, behavioral and family problems, with treatment modality determined by the needs of the case. In recent years children have been seen under my supervision for problems including learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, behavior and attentional disorders, conduct disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. Students under my direction have learned to use cognitive-behavioral therapy, play therapy, crisis management, and family therapy approaches, and to integrate these diverse theoretical models in developing effective strategies for intervention. DALE STACK,  CRDH  Member,  Research Interests My clinical experience is in the area of assessment and treatment of difficulties that occur in children (and their families).   My particular focus is working with very young children (preschoolers) and their families.   This area encompasses a range of problems including (but not limited to) developmental delays, expressive and/or receptive language delays, pervasive developmental disorders, behavior problems, sensory and physical disabilities, adjustment difficulties, child management and parenting, and family issues.   My general approach is cognitive-behavioral.   I underscore the importance of comprehensive assessment and I utilize alternative assessment procedures when valuable (e.g., non-verbal, non-compliant, etc.,).   Given the age range of the children, my clinical work involves direct contact with the child and his/her parent(s)/caregivers (and family).   ", "title": "Clinical faculty & supervisors"},

[PubMed] [Content] Biography Dave Mumby received his Ph.D. in Biopsychology from the University of British Columbia in 1992. In 1994, after 18 months in a postdoctoral research position in Dr. Robert Sutherland's laboratory at the University of New Mexico, Dr. Mumby joined the Department of Psychology at Concordia University. In 1999 he joined the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology. Fun fact I have chickens at home, and I'm thinking of ways to formally test their memory abilities. Seriously. Research Object recognition, spatial memory, fear learning, context memory, neural systems Overview: My interests broadly include animal cognition, and the analysis and development of methods and procedures for assessing various types of memory in rodents. For example, some of our recent studies revealed concerns about the internal validity of a widely-used novel-object preference test of object-recognition memory. We are now developing a new and improved object-recognition task. We also study spatial memory, fear learning, memory for contextual information, and the modulation of memory by contextual cues. We employ an array of behavioral paradigms to assess different aspects of memory, including water-maze, t-maze, radial-arm maze, and open-field tests of spatial memory, novel-object preference and delayed nonmatching-to-sample tests of object recognition, shock-probe fear learning, predator avoidance, and social transmission of food preferences. Additional interests include the anatomy of memory systems underlying object-recognition and spatial memory. We occasionally conduct studies to assess these abilities in rats with surgical lesions of specific brain areas. Past studies have focused mainly on hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, amygdala, intralaminar and midline thalamus. To develop their reputations as independent researchers, my graduate students are encouraged to pursue lines of inquiry they can call their own. The main requirements for a suitable research plan are: 1) the questions must be timely and important to behavioural neuroscientists, 2) we must have the financial and physical resources to conduct the research, and 3) we must have expertise with the required behavioural tests. Recent Ph.D. students did dissertation research on a rat model of schizophrenia, and the modulatory effects of estrogen on object-recognition memory.

Published by the Azrieli Foundation as The Vale of Tears, translated by Vivian Felsen, Hirschprung s memoir is a moving account of his escape from Nazi persecution. Rabbi Hirschprung s memoir evokes a moment of transition in the history of the North American Jewish community when the magnitude of the ongoing Nazi destruction of European Jewry was becoming known but was still shrouded in the fog of war, and when the North American Jewish community was beginning to understand the immense challenges it faced. The symposium will examine three major aspects of the life of the Montreal and, more generally, the North American Jewish community in 1944. Subjects to be examined include Orthodox Judaism, Yiddish culture and the Yiddish press, and the attitude of the North American Jewish community toward refugees from Nazi persecution. The symposium will conclude with the official book launch of The Vale of Tears.

At least one in four Canadians will have an anxiety disorder in their lifetime. While effective therapies for these often-debilitating disorders exist, many sufferers find them very difficult to engage with or complete. This prompted researchers at Concordia to look for ways to make treatment easier to handle for those who need it most. In studies recently published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders and forthcoming in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Concordia psychology researchers Hannah Levy and Adam Radomsky show that the very behaviours people use to avoid anxiety could become part of an effective treatment, and that patients have a significant role to play in deciding when those behaviours are no longer necessary. Radomsky and Levy focus on safety behaviours   things people do to make themselves feel less anxious. Examples include wearing gloves when touching dirty objects, avoiding eye contact during stressful interactions, distracting yourself when doing something scary   any behaviour that increases feelings of safety in anxiety-provoking situations.  Traditionally, psychologists thought that fading out or eliminating these behaviours entirely should be the primary focus of the therapy used to combat anxiety disorders. But we found that changing those behaviours and giving patients greater agency is much more effective,  says Radomsky, professor in Concordia s Department of Psychology and senior author of the studies. He and Levy followed 157 study participants   ranging from people with low-level anxieties to those diagnosed OCD   as they adapted old habits with new ones that they could use to avoid anxiety during exposure therapy, in which the therapist exposes the patient to feared objects or situations without any danger. The researchers found that using new safety behaviours during exposure therapy was slightly more helpful to participants than their usual or typical safety behaviours. They also found that the most important aspect of reducing the use of safety behaviours in therapy is that the client or patient be the one who decides when they are ready to move forward without them.   This is different from the standard approach in which therapists encourage people to drop their safety behaviours at the outset of the therapy, which often leads people to drop out or refuse the treatment. Under the right conditions, safety behaviours have the potential to make the therapy more effective, and more acceptable,  explains Levy, who recently defended her PhD in psychology at Concordia and will graduate this summer. Radomsky, who also holds a Concordia University Research Chair in Anxiety and Related Disorders, says the results of the research could help therapists shape their approach to best help each person with whom they re working.  It s our hope that these findings will help to reduce the number of people who refuse or drop out of cognitive behavioural therapies and should result in more people getting the help that they need.

Concordia researchers explain how fancy glassware and the sight of a liquor store can facilitate alcohol addiction Posted on May 25, 2016 | Version fran aise  Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues.  | Photo by Photholic (Flickr CC) Humans aren t much different from other animals. Just like Pavlov s dogs , we can become conditioned to associate environmental cues with rewards. Innocent enough when the sight of your sneakers makes you want to go for a run, but not necessarily so when the sight of the liquor store prompts you to want a drink. Indeed, Pavlovian cues that predict alcohol can lead us toward addiction. And sometimes those cues can become desirable in and of themselves, as shown in a new study by Concordia researchers, published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience .  Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues,  says Nadia Chaudhri , the study s lead author and professor in the Department of Psychology .  Conditioned reactions to those cues can trigger behaviours that result in drinking, like turning into the SAQ or reaching for a beer.  The results of the study suggest that cues that predict alcohol can become highly desirable; therefore, people may keep drinking because of the pleasure derived from our interactions with them. According to this research, drinkers wishing to make a change in their habits shouldn t just focus on the booze itself, but on all the factors that surround alcohol consumption.  Many people have specialized glassware for different kinds of drinks, and strong preferences for what they drink,  Chaudhri explains.  These preferences could be driven by the sensory properties of alcohol, like its taste, smell and how it looks. It is important for people to realize that drinking alcohol is a complex behaviour, and in addition to what alcohol does to our brains, it also plays a role in regulating our behaviours.  For the study, Chaudhri and her co-authors, former Concordia student Chandra Srey and postdoctoral researcher Jean-Marie Maddux , worked with 25 lab rats who were conditioned to associated a specific cue with the presence of ethanol   the main kind of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks. The researchers paired a visual cue with the ethanol so that rats would come to expect alcohol every time they saw that cue. Eventually, when the cue was presented, rats approached the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. But after a time they stopped performing this behaviour and instead began approaching and interacting with the cue. This happened even though the rats gained nothing by playing with the cue, and would actually have been better served by approaching the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. The researchers also noted that the rats would work to earn presentations of a cue that was previously paired with alcohol, even when alcohol was not dispensed along with that cue. These results suggest that a cue that predicts alcohol can become highly desireable. So how can rat behaviour help explain human addiction?  Lots of our behaviours are governed by fundamental learning mechanisms that are also present in other animal species,  says Chaudhri.  By modelling these behaviours in rats we can better understand the factors that control how these behaviours are acquired and maintained in humans.  She explains that we can use animal models to figure out ways to minimize unwanted behaviours like responding to cues that predict alcohol.  This knowledge can then be brought back to the clinic, where we can test similar strategies in humans,  says Chaudhri.  Rat models can also be used to inform us of the brain mechanisms that are important for behaviour. These basic science studies provide a critical foundation for the development of treatments for disorders like alcohol abuse and addiction.  Chaudhri will soon present the results of this and other related studies at the upcoming Society for Quantitative Analyses of Behavior annual symposium taking place May 27 to 28 in Chicago.

New Concordia research published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology shows that may be thanks to the hormones that trigger the menstrual cycle.  Women have sometimes reported to doctors that their memory works differently depending on which phase of the menstrual cycle they are in  even during and following pregnancy, or following menopause. This has led scientists to wonder whether estrogen and progesterone could affect memory and problem solving,  says psychology professor Wayne Brake , who co-authored the study.  Our research shows that, rather than impairing memory in general, estrogen and progesterone may instead cause the brain to favour one memory system or strategy over another.    Hormones influence problem-solving For the study, researchers tested 45 women who had regular menstrual cycles. First, participants responded to a  hormonal profile  questionnaire that gathered detailed information on their periods, past pregnancies, contraceptive and synthetic hormone intake history and general life habits. The participants were then given a verbal memory task, such as remembering a list of words, as well as a virtual navigation task, such as finding their way through a maze in a video game, that could be solved in several ways. At the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed on how they solved the tasks from beginning to end. Results were clear: women who were ovulating performed better on the verbal memory task. On the other hand, women tested in their pre-menstrual phase were better at solving spatial navigation tasks. That proves that women tend to use different strategies to solve tasks   such as navigating a maze or remembering a list of words   depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle. Essentially, the study shows that the hormonal changes women experience throughout their cycles have a broader impact than previously believed, and have significant effects on how women approach and solve problems.  This is important scientifically. We and others have previously shown that the levels of estrogen and progesterone in rodents influence different brain regions, affecting various memory systems involved in task-solving,  says Brake.  For example, when estrogen levels are high, female rats will use one type of memory system or strategy versus another to solve a maze. This is the first study to show that this is also true for women, who solve tasks in different ways based on their hormones  'Research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain' For recent PhD graduate Dema Hussain, the study s lead author, these results point to an ongoing bias in scientific research.  Traditionally, researchers and scientists have relied on using male participants   and male rats   in studies to develop drugs and treatments for the general population. But we now know that women respond differently than men,  she says.  I hope that this study emphasizes that more research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain, and that efforts must be made to tailor future research to improve our understanding of the effects of female sex hormones on cognition and memory.

Following a successful inaugural season, Beyond Disciplines is back for another year of interdisciplinary discussion and exploration. The public series, created by the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS), examines issues of the day through a variety of perspectives. In 2015 16, topics included gene editing and CRISPR technology , storytelling in research and the future of diversity . The series also spawned a podcast , which is ongoing.  Last year really exceeded our expectations,  says Andr  Roy , dean of FAS.  So, naturally, we want to set the bar even higher.  On Thursday, October 20, the first Beyond Disciplines event of the season,   Come to your senses: Sensescapes in research and in life ,  invites the audience to experience a variety of sensory-themed presentations. Held in collaboration with Concordia s Centre for Sensory Studies, the evening will be hosted by centre co-director David Howes . According to Roy, this year s series won t follow the traditional format of a panel discussion and Q&A.  We really wanted to mix things up and start with something completely different.  Claudine Gauthier is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and one of the upcoming featured speakers. For her, the experience is a rare opportunity to exchange on a topic of research with people from very different fields, and share different perspectives with the public. Gauthier s presentation will discuss how the brain \"sees\" images and how this changes with age.  I will show Magnetic Resonance Imaging pictures of the brain in action during a task, and how we can learn about changes in brain function and aging from these images,  she explains.  Thinking outside the box  Fellow presenter Owen Chapman , associate professor in Communication Studies , will offer an audiovisual experience based on work developed in the Mobile Media Lab that he co-directs.  I will DJ/VJ a short set featuring remixing of both local and distant audio field recordings through an immersive 3D virtual soundscape platform,  says Chapman.  I hope to prompt users to think about the causes and effects of the sounds of one's everyday life.  Another first for Beyond Disciplines this year? Inviting people from outside FAS. Featured panellists in the  Come to your senses  event include Cynthia Hammond , Shauna Janssen and Rhona Richman Kenneally , all from the Faculty of Fine Arts .  I have been investigating the intersections between taste as a sense experience and taste as sanctioned design or style,  explains Richman Kenneally, a professor in the Department of Design and Computation Arts and a fellow in the School of Irish Studies .  I am really looking forward to participating in this event, since my academic training as well as my ongoing research are fundamentally grounded in transdisciplinarity across design and the humanities.  Roy says the series plans to continue thinking outside the box, and promises more surprises as the season unfolds.  We have always said we wanted to explore different forms and formats.

Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, October 7. The recognition comes at the perfect time: five days after 50.2 per cent of voters rejected  a peace agreement with FARC, the oldest and biggest guerrilla group in the world. Today, as a graduate student at Concordia, I can think over what this means for me, for my country and for my academic career. I grew up in an urban context, distant from the day-to-day armed conflict. However, as is true for all Colombians, I grew up knowing that my country was one of the most violent places in the world. That motivated me to conduct research oriented toward informing peace education. When applying to the PhD in Psychology Program at Concordia, I included in my statement of purpose an explanation about how this would be  a secure step toward contributing to knowledge about the healthy development of children in order to meliorate the reality of Colombia and other countries.  I had the fortune to be accepted into the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory directed by William Bukowski , who has a deep knowledge of Colombian culture and has conducted research there over the last decade. This allowed me to maintain contact with my country, as did the Concordia Graduate Student Mobility Award that I got in 2015. That award allowed me to conduct a summer practice in Colombia, and to contribute to the production of a national report on students  results on citizenship abilities and a document on peace education directed to parents. I have to confess that despite all my purpose as a researcher in training, I was skeptical about seeing the end of the war in Colombia before I died. My hopelessness diminished when it was announced that the government and FARC would sign an agreement of peace, but increased again when I saw that not only had Colombians chosen to decline the referendum but also that 63 per cent of Colombians did not take part in the democratic process.   On Friday morning, thanks to an email from Dr. Bukowski, I found out that Santos was awarded the Nobel Prize, and optimism came back to me. As a supporter of the current agreement, I think that this prize represents pressure on the actors to find a prompt solution. The government, the opposition and FARC leaders will have to find a way to renegotiate the aspects that still need to be revised. The prize committee in Oslo was clear that this recognition is a tool to support Santos and his team in their intention to end a war that has been going on for 50 years. I have to say that on the negative side, Colombians have a culture  of the moment.  We glorify and celebrate while we forget the actual challenges we have to face. The main challenge is to change the minds of thousands of my compatriots who did not treat the peace discussion as a serious topic. I do not mean the people who voted either yes or no in the referendum   I am referring to those who did not participate. But in the face of a deeply divided country, this news brings us hope again.

On October 18, Poulin-Dubois is being honoured with a career award   the Prix Acfas Th r se Gouin-D carie for social science. The Association francophone pour le savoir (Acfas) hosts the largest multidisciplinary gatherings of research and knowledge in the French-speaking world.  Professor Diane Poulin-Dubois s groundbreaking scholarship in early cognitive and language development is widely esteemed by peers and practitioners,  says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies at Concordia.  We are delighted to see her receive such prestigious recognition from Acfas for the impact she has made within and beyond academe, nationally and internationally.  This isn t the first time that Acfas has recognized Poulin-Dubois s contributions. In 1996, she won the Prix du meilleur article de vulgarisation scientifique de l ACFAS (faculty award).

She is now retired but we talk frequently. She joked that my win has been like a resurrection for her.  This career award has also been gratifying for Poulin-Dubois, who is donating a portion of her $5,000 Acfas prize money to La Fondation du Dr. Julien which provides support to underprivileged children.  We work hard and this is recognition for what we do.  Just last year, her team published a study that proves that toddlers who learned more doublets (for example,  dog/chien ) over a seven-month period were ahead of the monolingual toddlers in executive function. This relates to skills such as planning, inhibition control and self-regulation. Her other recent work is in a relatively new field of social cognition called  trust,  which is the study of how children detect who to believe when acquiring new information.  We already know that preschoolers are more likely to learn from individuals with a history of making accurate claims over individuals who have been inaccurate or ignorant,  says Poulin-Dubois.  My particular contribution and insight is determining the origin of this ability. Which characteristics of the model are they sensitive to? Then you can speculate how our species has evolved differently or similarly to others.

The new opportunity he is pursuing speaks to the world-class quality of his personal research program  and to the respect that Concordia is earning as an important and unique contributor to the field of medical research in Montreal,  As the inaugural PERFORM chair and scientific director, Louis s vision, energy, appetite for collaboration and ambition for success have put the centre on the map. His tireless work has enabled us to recruit outstanding faculty of international quality, attract top-quality students and postdocs and emerge as an important new partner in the Quebec and Canadian landscape of health research.  I am proud of and grateful for everything that Louis has given to Concordia. He is a true leader. I know I am not alone in being sad at his decision to move over the mountain, but I am very eager to pursue new collaborations as he embarks on the next phase of his astonishing career.  For his part, Bherer is proud of what the PERFORM research team has been able to accomplish over the last four years.  We ve laid the foundation for our mission of advancing research, education and community engagement while offering unique opportunities for new discoveries in preventive health research,  he says.  With the support and guidance of the exceptional team of researchers, students and staff we have established, PERFORM will continue to blossom in the years to come.  Looking forward, Carr is extremely pleased that PERFORM will be in safe hands under the leadership of Habib Benali, given the scope of his international research and administrative portfolio, his extraordinary connections with the health research community in Montr al and his commitment to the institutional vision for PERFORM.  We are unbelievably fortunate that a person of Habib s calibre and experience is poised to accept the interim scientific director position,  says Carr.  As an engineer who also has deep connections in the Faculty of Arts and Science, he will continue to advance PERFORM s role in fostering interdisciplinary research and training collaborations between numerous departments and faculties, as well as with our many inter-institutional research networks.  Benali s research examines how multimodal imaging and computational modelling can be used to better understand which factors promote a healthy lifestyle. The internationally renowned scientist from Paris, who has received multiple distinctions and research awards, brings a wealth of leadership experience to the position. Prior to joining Concordia earlier this year, he served as co-director of the International Laboratory of Neuroimaging and Modelling (LlNeM), a collaboration of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (lNSERM), Universit  Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC, part of the Sorbonne Universities) and Universit  de Montr al. Benali was the head of the Laboratory of Functional Imaging (INSERM U678 unit, France) until 2013, and served as the deputy director of the 110-member Biomedical Imaging Laboratory U1146, INSERM   part of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and UPMC University   until 2015. He looks forward to his new leadership role at Concordia. \"My goal is to develop strong relationships with other research teams generating and fostering preventive health research, and research engineering teams, in particular, on the regional, national and international scene,  he says.  I hope to provide the scientific direction to make the PERFORM Centre a world leader in research, education and community involvement for better health.  Carr says that the leadership team at the centre, which also includes Jean-Paul Soucy, PERFORM associate director of bio-imaging and a professor at McGill University, an outstanding professional staff, and a strong team of department chairs and research scientists who help to execute the vision for PERFORM, will continue to have Concordia s full support as they work to increase the visibility and impact of preventive and healthy lifestyle research.

Long afternoons practising scales. All that time you spent in piano lessons and dance classes as a youngster may have seemed like a pain, but new research now confirms what your parents claimed: it s good for mind and body. In fact, a recent study published in NeuroImage by a team* of researchers from the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research, proves that dance and music training have even stronger effects on the brain than previously understood   but in markedly different ways. The researchers used high-tech imaging techniques to compare the effects of dance and music training on the white matter structure of experts in these two disciplines. They then examined the relationship between training-induced brain changes and dance and music abilities.  We found that dancers and musicians differed in many white matter regions, including sensory and motor pathways, both at the primary and higher cognitive levels of processing,  says Chiara Giacosa, PhD candidate in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and the study s lead author. In particular, dancers showed broader connections of fibre bundles linking the sensory and motor brain regions themselves, as well as broader fibre bundles connecting the brain s two hemispheres   in the regions that process sensory and motor information. In contrast, musicians had stronger and more coherent fibre bundles in those same pathways.  This suggests that dance and music training affect the brain in opposite directions, increasing global connectivity and crossing of fibres in dance training, and strengthening specific pathways in music training,  Giacosa explains.  Indeed, while dancers train their whole body, which has a broader representation in the neural cortex, musicians focus their training on some specific body parts, such as hands, fingers or the mouth, which have a smaller cortical representation in the brain.   This work has major potential  Interestingly, dancers and musicians differed more between each other than in comparison to the group of control subjects who had no extensive formal training in either field. According to Giacosa, this can happen because a range of uncontrolled variables influenced the control subjects in different ways, making them more similar to one group or the other.  Contrary to that, our samples of dancers and musicians were specifically selected to be pure groups of experts, which makes it easier to differentiate between them.  Virginia Penhune , professor in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and chair of its Department of Psychology , is the study s senior author. She notes that this research deepens the current knowledge about how regions of the brain are connected in networks, and how these structural networks change with training.  This work has major potential for being applied to the fields of education and rehabilitation,  Penhune says.  Understanding how dance and music training differently affect brain networks will allow us to selectively use them to enhance their functioning or compensate for difficulties and diseases that involve those specific brain networks.  Some studies have already shown how music training at a young age can improve various cognitive skills, but dance has yet to be used in a similar way.  Recent research has started to show some improvements with dance and music therapy in patients affected by Parkinson s disease and children with autism respectively, but much more can be done with these and other diseases,  says Penhune. *Partners in research: The co-authors of this study   Chiara Giacosa, Falisha J.

On June 17 and 18, alumni of the Centre will return to Concordia for A Night at the Oscar, a monumental retrospective variety show at the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall. How it all began The CAHD was officially created in 1996, but the catalyst for it occurred in 1993 when Lenore Vosberg, a social worker at the West Montreal Readaptation Centre, approached Concordia s Stephen Snow , then a professor of theatre and currently an associate professor of drama therapy and chair of the Department of Creative Arts Therapies, about staging a play with her clients.  It was magical, it just came together. People were astounded. That first play founded a 20-year tradition for the Centre,  says Snow, who recently became the first recipient of the Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health.* Every second year, the CAHD accepts 20 people with developmental disabilities referred by social workers at readaptation centres and CLSCs. Students come Mondays and Fridays for two years. At the end of their second year, they host a big public outreach event, usually a play. The group comes back on Wednesdays for a third and final year   the denouement, if you will. Ethnodramas and 100 original songs  The theme of our show is 'We Can',  says Lenore Vosberg, the CAHD executive director.  The song 'I Can' was from And Alice Dreams ... and we're expanding it to be 'We Can,' which will be our closing number. We have a core group of singers and behind them there will be everybody else, around 65 people, doing sign language for the lyrics.  Part of A Night at the Oscar will be dedicated to honouring the music of Shelley Snow, who has composed more than 100 original songs during her time as the Centre's music therapist. The CAHD has been at the forefront of using ethnodramas   plays based on the performers' lived experiences   as therapy. So far three ethnodramas have been produced, all to tremendous acclaim.   Stephen Goulet performed in 2012's  Our World: A Musical Ethnodrama  and really enjoyed his experience.  Some days were tough. But with all the bad stuff put aside, I loved every minute of it.  Goulet will also be performing in A Night at the Oscar. They always want me to come back, and I never say no.   Taking everyone for who they are  Choreographing the dance numbers for the retrospective is Gelymar Sanchez, a professional dancer and Concordia psychology student. She first began as a volunteer at the Centre in January 2015,  teaching yoga . Sanchez is working on six dance acts for the show, reshaping original choreography for some and creating others from scratch, each movement designed to suit the dancer.  It's about taking everyone for who they are and for their abilities, rather than their disabilities,  she says.  They keep on surprising me and renewing my vision of dance. Some of the participants are so talented, I feel they are five times better than the best professional dancers I've worked with before. They really blow my mind.  From the stage to the big screen The Centre's story is one that has resounded strongly with people far and wide. CBC made a documentary in 2000 about the CAHD play And Alice Dreams... called Finding Wonderland. In 2011, EyeSteelFilm released the documentary The Frog Princes , about the play The Frog & the Princess .  When CBC came, they were going to come for one day. They got so fascinated by the process, they stayed for two weeks,  says Snow. Because the cast for this year's play is comprised of past participants, the 2014-16 group's public outreach event is an art installation, part of which will be on display in the foyer of the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall during the performance nights. Art pieces will be available for sale. Crafts made by the  participants will also be available for purchase. Get your tickets today for the Centre for the Arts in Human Development retrospective show, A Night at the Oscar , taking place June 17 and 18 at the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall. *The Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health recognizes individuals or organizations for building awareness of mental health issues in the community through research, service, advocacy, combatting stigma or calling the public s attention to the needs of family caregivers. It was presented to Stephen Snow at the Annual General Meeting of AMI-Quebec Action on Mental Illness on June 7. Related Links ", "title": "A night at the Oscar"},

Concordia research associate Nuria de Zavalia explains how Daylight Saving Time affects our circadian rhythms, and how you can lessen the impact Posted on November 4, 2016 | By: J. Latimer  The extra hour of sleep sounds great, but when we change the time, there's an alteration of the circadian rhythms and that's when the problems start.  | Photo by Woodleywonderworks (Flickr CC) Is everyone ready to get an extra hour of sleep this weekend? At 2 a.m. this Sunday morning, November 6, we will return to standard time by moving our clocks back one hour. This change happens annually on the first Sunday in November   unless you live in most of Saskatchewan, Southampton Island in Nunavut or small pockets of Northwestern Ontario, Quebec or BC. These regions of Canada never opted into Daylight Saving Time (DST), although other cities and regions were using DST as early as 1918. Spring forward, fall back  The extra hour of sleep sounds great, but when we change the time, there's an alteration of the circadian rhythms and that's when the problems start,  says Nuria de Zavalia, a research associate who works with Shimon Amir , a psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia. It's like jet lag, she adds, explaining that alterations in the circadian system can affect alertness, mood, stress hormone levels, memory formation, cognitive performance, metabolism, cardiovascular system and, especially, depression.  Daylight Saving Time does not help people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder , for example,  says de Zavalia.  And research has shown that the Monday after the time change   especially in the spring, when we have one hour less sleep   there is an increase in car accidents, heart attacks and depressive episodes .  So, what can be done to lessen the effects of returning to standard time?  Start early,  says de Zavalia.  If you can change the clocks a few days early, in 10-minute increments instead of a full hour in one shot, it ll be easier on your system.

I want to know what people are up to,  says Nisi Sinzinkayo, a Moncton, N.B., transplant. For her, Concordia s Department of Psychology was a natural fit. As Sinzinkayo says:  I see this as a way to understand people even more.  Department of Psychology student Nisi Sinzinkayo Before taking the plunge and moving to Montreal for her undergraduate studies, Sinzinkayo had developed a strong opinion of both Concordia and Montreal.  I visited the city and have friends who attended Concordia,  says Sinzinkayo.  I like how open-minded people are here. People don t judge you.  One hurdle for Sinzinkayo is the costs that come with studying.  Coming out of province, tuition is automatically more expensive,  says Sinzinkayo. Add to that, she notes that there are living expenses such as rent and public transit. Sinzinkayo received the Leonard and Bina Ellen Entrance Bursary her first year of study in 2014.  That was a great email to receive,  says Sinzinkayo, who entered the university as a teenager directly from high school.  I have siblings, so I think of all the things my parents help pay for. The bursary was welcome news for all of us,  she says. Sinzinkayo already has long-term career ambitions.   If I could continue going with psychology, that would be great,  says Sinzinkayo.  I would like to complete a PhD.   Psychology is a good foundational education. As a  plan B  I would want to go into marketing.  Sinzinkayo expects to finish her bachelor s degree by 2018. #CUgiving Read more inspiring stories like this one in Momentum, Concordia's Donor and Student Awards newsletter.

Take the test The free rapid-HIV testing is happening both days from 12 to 4 p.m. in Room 711, on the Sir George Williams Campus. It's sponsored in part by Clinical Projects Grant from the Ordre r gional des infirmi res et infirmiers de Montr al/Laval, as well the CSU Special Projects fund. The CSU, Queer Concordia , Health Services and the Concordia Undergraduate Psychology Association (CUPA) are collaborating to run the testing events. To choose from a variety of free condoms at the give-away, simply go to the Atrium of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB) on the Sir George Williams Campus. You can always get free condoms at the weekly Healthy YOU at CU information table, or come by Health Services Condom Boutique where you can choose from a variety of condoms, \"3-for-$1\"!  The goal is to remind students that regular STI testing is a normal part of taking care of your health, just like going to the dentist,  says Gabriella Szabo, health promotion specialist with  Health Services .  And students get their results in 20 minutes, rather than 10 days.  Be informed and empowered December 1 is World Aids Day and a perfect occasion to have a clear-headed conversation about sexually transmitted infections (STIs). CATIE , a Canadian online source for information and resources about HIV and AIDS, is a good place to learn more about the history and contemporary reality of the disease. The Concordia University Community Lecture Series on HIV/AIDS has its fourth event on December 1 from 6:45 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the Museum of Fine Arts. London artist Conal McStravick will discuss the impact of the AIDS crisis on art and parallel queer activist movements at the event, entitled Meet Stuart Marshall - Art, Activism, and the AIDS Crisis: Learning in a Public Medium. Consent is essential to practicing safer sex. Last February, the two-day student organized fair, called  Sexpress Yourself , helped propel the dialogue on campus about safe and consensual sex with similar events. At the time, Jennifer Drummond, coordinator of the Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC) explained:  We want to reach as many students as we can and make sure they know about our support services and activities,  she says.  Outreach activities like this are also great opportunities to start important conversations and provide information about consent, bystander intervention and preventing sexual violence.

By participating in research, these students have the opportunity to gain a better appreciation of psychological testing and experimentation. However, as there are potential risks associated with classroom recruitment and student testing, these guidelines are intended to facilitate the collection of participants and/or data in undergraduate classroom settings at Concordia University, while protecting the rights of student research participants. Approaching the Instructor The instructor should be provided with the following information well in advance of the classroom visit: Who is supervising the project. When the recruiter would prefer to visit the class. How long the class visit will take. The nature of the recruitment (sign up sheet, screening questionnaire, etc.) What (if any) testing will occur at the time of recruitment. Recruiting in Class When the recruiter visits the classroom, the following information should be provided to the students: The name of the recruiter(s) and the faculty member(s) supervising the project. Contact information for the lab(s) in which the study is being conducted. What the study is meant to investigate. The nature of the study (questionnaire based, interview based, brief description of experimental tasks, etc.). The amount of time required to participate in the study. What compensation (if any) participants will receive for their time. When the study is being conducted (Are appointments set?, Can students drop by the lab?, etc.). Student should be informed that the data that they may provide during the course of their participation are completely unrelated to their required coursework or grade. That participation is completely voluntary and that participants can refuse or withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences whatsoever. The nature and/or limits of confidentiality in the study. Ideally, the recruiter should leave the room while sign up sheets and/or questionnaires are being completed so that students will be free to either participate or decline to participate. Testing in Class Due to the possible demands produced by testing in groups, in the presence of experimenters and/or in the presence of course instructors, testing in classrooms is discouraged. If in-class testing is deemed to be essential, the following measures (in addition to the above 10 points) should be taken to protect students from coercion and to ensure the confidentiality of their participation: Participants should be told that their results will not be made available to their instructor. Participants who choose not to participate should not be separated or otherwise identified during classroom testing. (This may be accomplished by distributing packages to all students in the class and then stating that students are free to either spoil the materials or leave them blank before returning them.) In addition to written debriefing (see below), students should receive a brief oral debriefing in class about the purpose of the study. Debriefing All experimental and study participants have the right to be debriefed from psychological studies. In order to facilitate both a greater understanding of research in psychology and to provide other sources of related information about the study, student participants should receive a brief written debriefing sheet (less than one half page) upon completion of the study. The debriefing sheet should contain the following information: The name of the study, the experimenter(s) and the faculty supervisor(s). The telephone and other contact information for the lab(s) in which the study was conducted as well as contact information for the University Human Research Ethics Committee and the Psychology Department Ethics Committee. *The nature of the study (hypotheses, goals, etc.). *Some information about the design of the study (groups, measures, etc.). A brief statement about the importance or implications of the study. Citation of one or two suggested articles or book chapters for further reading. *If the study involves deception, it is acceptable for items 3 and 4 to be somewhat vague when distributed in written form, provided that a full oral debriefing is given to each participant. Ideally, this sheet will be accompanied by a brief oral debriefing period in which the above are explained to the student participant.

Clients at the APC are seen by graduate students under the supervision of clinical faculty. The types of services offered by the APC reflect the interests of clinical supervisors and students, and may include individual, family, or marital psychotherapy, cognitive-behaviour therapy for anxiety or stress, and treatment of child disorders. External training facilities Extramural practica, as well as an accredited senior predoctoral internship ( Concordia University Psychology Internship Programme ) may be carried out in a variety of local hospital settings. Some of the local sites where clinical graduate students are typically placed for external practica include: McGill Mental Health Service - Clinical Psychology Practicum and Internship Program The McGill Mental Health Service offers advanced clinical practica and internships to graduate students in Ph.D. Clinical Psychology programs. Our team consists of Psychologists, Psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Practicum students and interns are an integral and valued part of our team and we offer a warm and supportive environment. Given the breadth and depth of our program, we provide an excellent training opportunity for those who eventually want to work in private practice. We provide short and long-term psychological treatment to the undergraduate and graduate population at McGill University. We also have an emergency walk-in service. The population is extremely diverse: we treat clients from different cultural backgrounds and ages. Clients present with a wide range of Axis I and Axis II disorders. Students applying to our program should have a strong interest in the area of Adult/Young Adult mental health. Royal Victoria Hospital The Royal Victoria Hospital is a general hospital setting. Within Psychology, there are four distinct training programs, each with its own set of supervisors, seminars and clinical experiences. These programs include Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Adult Services Psychology, Sex and Couple Therapy as well as Child/Adolescent Psychology. Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital This setting is a specialized care hospital in Neurology and the practicum in Psychology is neuropsychological in emphasis. Most patients are assessed in order to determine whether they are suitable candidates for neuro-surgery. A variety of psychomotor and cognitive tests are administered. Both English and French test batteries are used. Neuropsychological assessment is the focus. Clients served include inpatients, epileptic patients, OCD patients, tourette syndrome patients, etc. The ages of clients served range from teenagers to the elderly. Douglas Hospital The Douglas Hospital is one of the largest Psychiatric Hospital Centres in Montreal. In addition to in-patients, the centre provides out-patient services through various community clinics and hospital units. It offers a wide range of clinics and services, which serve children, adolescents and adults. Orientations cover psychodynamic, systemic, cognitive, behavioural and psychoeducational. The Montreal Children's Hospital The Department of Psychology of The Montreal Children's Hospital offers summer practicum in pediatric and clinical child psychology. The program provides unique opportunities to apply child clinical skills to the prevention or management of psychological problems associated with physical disease or dysfunction. Situated in a major pediatric hospital setting, the practicum offers varied clinical experiences with children (0-18 years) and their families Sir Mortimer B. Davis-Jewish General Hospital The SMBD Jewish General Hospital is a general hospital setting serving a wide variety of medical, psychiatric and out-patients. There are several units/services within Psychology that are offered as Practicum placements, primarily at level II. For example, Early Childhood Development Service; Child Psychiatry Day/Evening Hospital; Child and Adolescent (OPD); Youth Service (OPD: age 16-20); Adult Day Treatment; Adult In-Patient; Cognitive Behaviour Therapy; Couple and Family Therapy; Adult Rehabilitation Service (OPD); Neuropsychology. A range of theoretical orientations are available including Cognitive-Behavioural, Family Systems, and Psychodynamic. The Montreal General Hospital The Psychological Services places equal value on individual and group therapy modalities. Trainees are assigned to in-patients, out-patients and emergency room rotations. Equal time is given to Psychological Assessments and Therapeutic intervention activities. Trainees attend seminars and present at academic events. The orientation is Psychoanalytic/Psychodynamic. St. Mary's Hospital St. Mary's is a general hospital with a psychology service which is principally affiliated with the Department of Psychiatry. The center s patient population is exclusively adult. The great majority of patients are referred from the outpatient psychiatric department or from family medicine. Trainees may conduct individual therapy or psychometric assessments to evaluate intellectual, memory, and perceptual-motor functions or to clarify diagnostic questions. The theoretical orientation of the center s staff varies considerably, with some having a psychodynamic approach and others being more cognitive-behavioural or humanistic.

In the first year, students with B.A. or B.Sc. degrees enter the Diploma in Clinical Psychology and the MA in Psychology. They conduct their master's thesis research, participate in research meetings in their area of specialization, and take courses in statistics/research design, psychological theory, psychopathology, and assessment. During the second year, students take courses in cognitive, behavioural, and other empirically supported treatments, receive practicum training in assessment and psychotherapy in the APC and, typically in the second summer, complete a full-time extramural clinical practicum. At the Ph.D. level, students also conduct their dissertation research, take advanced clinical and research seminars, participate in additional therapy practica, and write their Ph.D. comprehensive examinations. In the final year, students undertake a full-time, predoctoral internship (or two years half-time).

New students are accepted into our program by a faculty member willing to provide supervision and financial assistance. Each student is thus associated with a research team comprised of faculty and graduate students. A noteworthy feature of our program is that clinical students may study applied problems (e.g., child or adult psychopathology; high risk populations; adjustment in aging; health psychology) in their research teams, or they may also study more theoretical problems with humans (e.g., cognitive, social, and developmental processes; information processing and social cognition) or animals (e.g., appetitive motivation; drugs, hormones, and behaviour; reproductive behaviour). Because entering students often have had previous research experience and participate in advanced research in our program, by the time they complete the PhD degree they have achieved a high level of research specialization, and expertise. As a result of the high quality of our students' research, many have opportunities to present their research findings at national and/or international scientific conferences. There are several sources of funding for student travel to scientific conferences within the Department. Also, students are expected to publish articles based on their research in scientific journals. ", "title": "Research"},
{"url": "https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/programs/graduate/research-clinical-training.html", "body": " Research & clinical training option The research and clinical training option is based on the scientist-practitioner model.That is, clinical students fulfill the same research requirements as other students, but they also receive professional training in the delivery of psychological services. The program's goal is to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists who not only conduct research and contribute to the scientific base of the discipline but who are also competent mental health professionals. Because research is such an important part of our program, students seeking only professional training or who do not intend to continue to the PhD degree should apply elsewhere. Overview Students with BA or BSc degrees begin their studies in the first year of the research and clinical training option, which includes course work in psychological theory and research design, clinical theory and practice, and a master's thesis. Students enroll in the MA in Psychology and the Diploma in Clinical Psychology. The MA portion of the research and clinical training option requires a minimum of one year of full time study, the Diploma an additional 8 months. Following successful completion of the master's thesis and courses, students continue doctoral studies, in which they receive advanced training in research methods, psychological theory, and clinical practice. Besides continuous involvement in research in one of the department's four areas of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, and Human Development and Developmental Processes) during their training, students also conduct a doctoral thesis, which must be a substantive piece of original research. The doctoral program requires a minimum of two years of full-time study. Following their doctoral thesis research, students complete a one-year, full-time internship in a clinic or hospital setting.  Our clinical psychology program has been accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association since 1986 and by the Ordre des psychologues du Qu bec since 2004. The Canadian Psychological Association requires disclosure of information on the applicant pool, acceptance rates, diversity, graduates, and other details about our programme. This information can be found here . For more details on the policies and procedures of the clinical program please refer to the policies and procedures manual .

This means that we strongly endorse the principle that a scientist-practitioner has a research orientation to his/her practice, and we encourage clinical relevance in research. Our model encompasses learning and career pathways individually tailored to student interest and faculty expertise. This permits a wide range of research emphases including those of basic research, while at the same time placing the highest value on the close integration of science and practice. The principal objective of our program is to produce graduates who have the necessary skills to function as researchers and as practitioners, who may function as either or both, and who meet the highest standards in the science and practice of psychology. Program goals & outcomes Our program adheres to the Accreditation Criteria and Principles of the Canadian and American Psychological Associations and the Ordre des psychologues du Qu bec in its specific goals for clinical training. The principal objective is that a graduate of our program be capable of functioning as an investigator and as a practitioner, and may function as either or both, consistent with the highest standards in psychology (Belar & Perry, 1992, p. 72). Our specific objectives include that our graduates: Be capable of conducting and publishing high quality psychological research in domains that have the potential to enhance the practice of psychology. Demonstrate knowledge of the theoretical and empirical roots in psychology of both clinical research and practice, and of current relevant developments in other areas of specialization in psychology. Demonstrate specialized knowledge of the major theoretical, methodological, and empirical work in clinical psychology, with both adults and children. Be capable of implementing theory-based, research-supported clinical practice, including assessment and treatment, with both adults and children. Demonstrate ethical and professional awareness and conduct in both their practice and their research. Be competent in dealing with individual and cultural diversity in values, beliefs and customs. Be capable of communicating knowledge to others. Be capable of consulting effectively with other professions, clients, and organizations. Be familiar with models of supervision, and competent in the supervision of other professionals. Functions for which students are prepared Students in our program receive the necessary academic, scientific, and clinical training so that they may contribute to psychological science and clinical practice in significant ways upon graduation. Our goal is to produce clinical psychologists who are highly trained in both the science of psychology and the methods of clinical practice, and who embody the roles of both researcher and clinical practitioner. Graduates of our program go on to careers in clinical and/or academic psychology in settings including hospitals, universities, health care clinics, and private practice.  Their activities are diverse and can include assessment, therapy, intervention, research, teaching, consultation, supervision and/or program planning in a wide variety of client populations.

The master's degree requires a minimum of one year of full-time study and involves - in addition to the thesis - course work in psychological theory and advanced statistics, seminars in the student's area of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, or Human Development and Developmental Processes), and directed teaching in our undergraduate program. The doctoral program involves similar advanced training: independent research; supervised reading, research and course work in subject matter and methods in the area of research specialization; program-wide research and methods seminars; and teaching experience. Doctoral studies require a minimum of two years of full-time study. Research Students are provided the resources to conduct research throughout their graduate education. All new students are accepted into our program by a faculty member who is willing to provide supervision and financial support. Thus, each student is associated with a research team comprised of faculty and graduate students. Research teams within the department are organized around four areas of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, or Human Development and Developmental Processes) and pursue a variety of topics, including (but not limited to) appetitive motivation and drug dependence, problems in human development, cognitive and perceptual processes, and anxiety disorders. Because entering students have often had previous research experience and participate in advanced research in our program, students who complete the Ph.D. degree achieve a high level of research specialization and expertise. As a result of the high quality of our students' research, most students have opportunities to present their research findings at national and/or international scientific conferences. There are several sources of funding within the Department for student travel to scientific conferences. Also, students are expected to publish articles on their research in scientific journals.

My research aims to explicate the positive (drinking to increase positive affect) and negative (drinking to reduce negative affect) reinforcement pathways that lead to problematic drinking, particularly for those transitioning from adolescence to early adulthood. Within this framework I examine the role of individual-level factors such as personality (i.e., motivational drive), anxiety, impulsivity, and alcohol-related cognitions (e.g., attitudes, associations, cognitive processes) to distinguish who is at risk and the processes of risk. In one line of my current work I am examining the interactive effects of behavioural inhibition/disinhibition and state affect on cue elicited alcohol associations, impulsivity, and subsequent alcohol use. Planned work in my lab includes: (a) refining measurement of alcohol-related cognition, such as assessments of implicit attitudes; (b) isolating social anxiety - and the intervening mechanisms - as a risk factor for negative reinforcement (self-medication) drinking in University students widely, and for women specifically; (c) integrating environmental-level factors (e.g., context)  into models of risk.

My research program is based on the theory          that psychological stress is a risk factor only in those individuals who          are in some manner psychologically and/or biologically susceptible, and          that the etiology of cardiovascular disease is multifactorial in nature.          My approach has therefore been to examine alone and in interaction the          moderating influences of emotion, race, gender and family history on the          cardiovascular response to psychological stress. For example, we are currently          involved in two areas of research involving individual difference factors          in the risk for cardiovascular disease. One research stream involves the          study of hostile individuals who are at elevated risk for heart disease.          We are currently examining their cardiovascular responses to interpersonal          stress, and the potential role of serotonin in moderating the hostility-cardiovascular          relationship. A second stream involves the study of cardiovascular and          ambulatory blood pressure responses to laboratory and daily life stress          in Canadian Black men and women who are at elevated risk for hypertension          (high blood pressure).

My projects are aimed at identifying and measuring the fundamental characteristics of children's interactions and relationships with their peers and determining how these experiences affect behavioral development, emotional adjustment and physical health.   The four current themes of my research projects are (a) contextual/cultural variation in the peer experiences and the processes that account for variations in their effects, (b)  the intersection between peer experiences and psychophysiology especially the response to stress, (c) gene/environment interactions  and gene environment correlations and the long term consequences of peer experiences, and (d) gender differences especially as they are related to culture.

By using photographs and video of natural scenes, my aim is to isolate what properties of an image do we use to recognize and classify the type of scene we are viewing, and how do changes in these properties alter our perception of the image. This research employed traditional techniques such as psychophysics and eye tracking, as well as new techniques such as computational neuroscience, gaze-contingent stimuli modifications, augmented virtual reality, as well as studying the underlying neural activity using EEG. My research  also focuses on how various visual (e.g., macular degeneration), cognitive  (e.g., stress, dual-tasking), and the loss of other senses (e.g., hearing loss) effect the visual system, and in particular, eye movements.

[PubMed] [Content] Research Drug and Alcohol Abuse, Relapse, Neuropharmacology, Pavlovian conditioning, Optogenetics Overview: Fundamental learning processes like Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning play a central role in the use, misuse and abuse of psychoactive substances like alcohol. In my laboratory, we use preclinical models in rats to study psychological processes and neurobiological systems that regulate drug-seeking behaviours and relapse. Neuroscientific techniques include neuropharmacology, in-vivo optogenetics, chemogenetics, in-vitro electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We are currently pursing three exciting research directions that probe the central hypothesis that environmental stimuli that become associated with alcohol help to maintain alcohol use and trigger relapse. Project 1 seeks to identify neural processes that are needed for the expression of alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Project 2 investigates brain mechanisms that mediate the inhibition or extinction of responding to Pavlovian cues that occurs when a cue is no longer followed by an expected event. Project 3 examines the effect of nicotine, the main active ingredient in tobacco, on alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Translational studies are also underway to test the utility of compounds that act on the cholinergic system in the brain in preventing relapse to alcohol seeking behaviour. Through this research, we hope to expand our understanding of how drug abuse develops and inform new treatments for dependence and addiction.

Concordia s signature public engagement series is back for 2016 with a new roster of events aimed at sparking conversation. Thinking Out Loud (TOL) brings together Concordia researchers and faculty members with external thought leaders for discussions about ideas, big and small. TOL 2016 has two parts   a series of public conversations in Montreal, co-sponsored by The Globe and Mail, and The Walrus Talks, which feature Concordia researchers and are organized in different Canadian cities in collaboration with The Walrus magazine. This year s Montreal TOL events take place onJanuary 28, February 11, March 1 and March 14 at the D.B. Clarke Theatre and are free of charge, although registration is required . Each talk will explore an aspect of connecting   for health and wellness, through the games we play and in the science and technology we use every day. These conversations will challenge the way we think about how we share our world. The Walrus Talks series brings Concordia faculty together with Canadian intellectuals in a series of seven-minute discussions on designated topics. If you re in Calgary, Ottawa or Toronto, watch for The Walrus Talks Health (Calgary, March 21), The Walrus Talks The Future (Ottawa, April 21) and (back by popular demand) The Walrus Talks Vice (Toronto, April 27).  More details to follow soon.  Both the Walrus Talks series and The Globe and Mail conversations offer great opportunities for us to engage our leading academics with thought leaders on subjects that are of interest to the public,  says Graham Carr, vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.

On December 10, Concordia recognized 253 employees who have reached milestones in their careers at the university with the annual Long Service and Retiree Luncheon. The numbers say it all. There were 21 people with 20 years of service, 46 with 25 years, 19 with 30 years, 27 with 35 years, 11 with 40 years, nine with 45 years, three with a remarkable 50 years, as well as 117 retirees. Benoit-Antoine Bacon , Concordia s provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs, congratulated staff and faculty for their dedicated service. He joked about trying to  wrap his head around  the fact that some of those being honoured had worked at Concordia when the Beatles were new on the pop music scene.  Thank you to everyone who has built Concordia into the amazing place that it is today,  said Bacon.  Everyone s unique contribution over the years has given us our character today.  June S. Chaikelson, 50 years at Concordia. | All photos by Concordia University Alan Shepard , the university s president, noted that  Manfred \"Fred\" Szabo  was celebrating his 51st year of service as a professor in the  Department of Mathematics and Statistics , while  June S. Chaikelson , a professor in the  Department of Psychology , and  Barry Frank , a professor in the  Department of Physics , were just one year behind, at 50 years of service.  After so many years the sense of bond we have with each other is strong,  said Shepard, before outlining Concordia s  strategic directions .  Maybe we met a mate here, sent our children to university here, and made deep connections. Concordia is ultimately about people, not buildings   As retirees, you re still ambassadors, so please continue to spread the word about Concordia and the new strategic directions that make us a next-generation university.  Representing the honourees, Eric Goldner, a manager of  Student Recruitment , took the microphone to discuss his experience growing up with a father who worked as a counsellor at Concordia. Goldner Jr. went on to contribute his own 25 years of service, and counting.  Now, as a student recruiter, when I tell prospective students and their parents about our long-term service, it resonates well,  said Goldner, who has held seven jobs in seven different departments across campus.  Each of us plays a part, and it wouldn t be the same without your contribution and commitment to the evolution of Concordia.  Peter Shizgal, 40 years at Concordia. \"It's gratifying to see how the institution has advanced and developed.\" Cheryl Williams, a retired department assistant from the  Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema , was among the honourees. Over the years, she has enjoyed following the careers of graduates, including feature film director Christian Duguay and animator Chris Hinton.  Sometimes, it felt like I had 300 kids,  laughed Williams, who served for 30 years.  The animators and film studies students are quiet, while the film production students are more outgoing. I ll miss them all.  Another honouree, Peter Shizgal , a professor of psychology, is celebrating 40 years of service. Like Williams, he enjoys the collegial nature of his department.  The department was on the rise when I started, and my area   behavioural neurobiology   really took off,  he said.  It s gratifying to see how the institution has advanced and developed.  Shizgal has no plans to retire. He will continue to focus his research on reward and decision making.  I have a grant that doesn t run out until 2018, and I ve applied to renew a grant that I ve had since 1976. It would provide funding until 2021.  Venkat Ramachandran, 45 years at Concordia. \"I'm proud to have been a part of that.\" Venkat Ramachandran , a professor from the  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , is celebrating 45 years at Concordia. His son followed his footsteps, studying electrical engineering at Concordia, and now teaches at Rowan University in New Jersey.

Concordia Vanier scholar Poppy Wilkinson investigates The PhD researcher examines narcissism in early adolescence Posted on December 16, 2015 | Source: University Communications Services What is the  healthy self  in early adolescents? That s the fundamental question behind Poppy Wilkinson's proposal to the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships program . Poppy Wilkinson:  My interests have always been about people   how people get along as a society, how they navigate the world.  Wilkinson, a Concordia MA and first-year PhD student in the university's  Department of Psychology , now has the financial support to focus on finding the answer. She landed the research scholarship in 2014 and, after a brief deferral, is now  joining Concordia's three 2015 Vanier recipients . The Government of Canada launched the Vanier program in 2008 to strengthen the country s ability to attract and retain world-class doctoral students, and establish Canada as a global centre of excellence in research and higher learning.  Annually, 167 Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships are awarded to national and international students. Winners receive $50,000 each, for three years. Narcissism, interrupted The official title of Wilkinson's project is  The Social Consequences of Self-Distortions During Early Adolescence: A Cross-Cultural Perspective.   I ll be studying the social functioning of early adolescents who see themselves more positively than is objectively warranted,  she says.  This kind of distortion in self-concept is known as narcissism.  She clarifies that she isn t studying the narcissistic personality disorder found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.  I m looking at what they call 'childhood normal narcissism.' While in the past, narcissism has been considered a disorder, recently it has also come to be understood as a normal-range individual difference.  Narcissism is characterized by a self-view that is at once grandiose and fragile, as it is highly contingent on the validation of others. It is associated with a host of negative behaviours including impulsivity, aggression, increased risk taking and exploitation, as well as unstable interpersonal relationships.  Surprisingly little is known about how narcissism functions in adulthood or childhood, particularly with respect to social experiences and peer groups,  adds Wilkinson.  In the literature, narcissism is usually assessed with self-report measures, but because narcissism plays out in the social realm, the perspective of peers is also important and interesting.  3 research goals Wilkinson's research comprises a three-part project concerning the social consequences of childhood normal narcissism in 10-to-12-year-olds in Canada, the Netherlands and Colombia. She ll be working out of the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory , which is also known as the Bukowski Lab, in reference to William Bukowski , a psychology professor at Concordia. It s part of the Centre for Research in Human Development (CRDH) . Wilkinson s three research goals are: 1. To clarify the association between narcissism, social validation and aggression 2. To better understand the social status of children high in narcissism 3. To explore cultural variations in adolescents' self-concept, and how these children function in their diverse social worlds  The results could lead to practical implications for educational settings,  says Wilkinson.  Some children benefit from initiatives aimed to boost self-esteem, but other children who feel superior may benefit from a different kind of intervention.  From English lit to psychology How did Wilkinson go from a BA in English literature to pursuing her PhD in psychology?  My interests have always been about people   how people get along as a society, how they navigate the world, why they do the things they do and what consequences this has for them and for those around them,  she says.  Analyzing the complex patterns and themes of human behavior is what attracted me to earn a bachelor s degree in English literature with a minor in socio-cultural anthropology. Indeed, a key element of any good story lies in how an individual s life history intersects with his or her social and cultural context.  It is these same core interests that drew Wilkinson to research peer relations in developmental psychology and, more specifically, cross-cultural individual differences in self-concept.

Linda Booij A strategic hire in trauma intervention for her department, Booij also recently joined the team of 40 researchers at Concordia s PERFORM Centre , which aims to improve health through scholarly inquiry, teaching and a wide range of community programs. Serotonin is important in mood and memory, among other functions, and has long been studied in relation to anxiety, depression, aggression and even suicidal impulses. Booij says her own work focuses on serotonin's role in the development of the human brain before birth and in early childhood. In particular, she's interested in the epigenetics of the question of how external environmental factors can cause genes to be \"switched on\" or \"turned off\" in the fetus and infant; and how it affects brain development. Gene activity is mainly determined by DNA, but scientists now know that an individual's environment can trigger some genes and quieten others. The challenge for Booij is to better understand how stresses during pregnancy and in the first years of life may lead to unwelcome changes via serotonin and other neurotransmitters.  We know from animal work that environmental factors can influence your neurochemicals, in utero and in childhood,\" Booij says. It is important to note that external stresses \"don't mean a person is stuck for life,  she adds.  There are many ways to compensate   you're not doomed to depression for example.\" Consequences may be modified, if not reversed, by, for instance, sound parenting, she says. A positive and enriching environment for an infant may help to compensate for perinatal stresses and early childhood adversity to the brain's development. \"We would expect from animal work that brain plasticity can take place: the brain is prone to change by environmental factors,  Booij says.  There is some evidence that some damage can be compensated for.\" She's studying the genes that regulate serotonin, but also those linked to other neurotransmitters, as well as to hormones and biochemicals that affect human brain development and behaviour. Her work involves neuro-imaging, and PERFORM, on the Loyola Campus, has equipment for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning. \"With this equipment we can look at the structure of the brain and how it responds to certain stimuli, and look at specific neurotransmitters.\" It's a complicated and important field. \"In the long term my research, a better understanding of early brain development, might help develop treatment, prevention and intervention programs for at-risk populations.\" Find out more about research at the PERFORM Centre .

On Monday, November 30, the first-ever Dean s Reception to Honour Excellence was held at the Loyola Jesuit Hall and Conference Centre. The celebration grew out of the annual Dean s Awards ceremony, which celebrated the achievements of staff and faculty.  This year, we wanted to expand the evening to include our new Concordia University Research Chairs, Canada Research Chairs and other research chairs, whose incredible work highlights the strengths of our faculty every day,  said Andr  Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science. Jason Camlot , associate dean of Faculty Affairs, oversaw the selection committee for the awards. He noted the overwhelming number of recommendations the three winners received. Winning staff members received a $500 gift certificate, and faculty members received $500 in research funding.   Staff and faculty award winners Gilles Pelsherbe , a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , won for Distinguished Scholarship in the Senior Scholar Category.  He is an extremely productive researcher,  said Camlot. Viviane Namaste , a professor in the Simone de Beauvoir Institute , won for Teaching Excellence. Camlot praised her for her extensive mentorship over the years.  Her students have been transformed by her personal interventions, and by her example,  he said. But perhaps the most memorable of the three winners was Ron Rehel , who recently retired from the Department of Exercise Science as a technical supervisor, following a 36-year career. Rehel received a standing ovation from the crowd when he accepted his award for Exceptional Service to the Faculty.  I always held the Concordia family in high esteem,  said Rehel.  It was a pleasure to work with these folks. In so many ways they are the reason I ended up receiving my award. I love my Concordia life!    Chair winners Next, the faculty s new research chairs were honoured.  They are chosen because of the vision for research in the faculty that they articulated in their applications for chair, and the leadership that they are expected to provide by holding the chair,  said Kim Sawchuk, the faculty s associate dean, Research and Graduate Studies. When he presented the chairs with their certificates and prizes, Roy put the academics on the spot. He asked them to sum up their field of research in one sentence. Thanh Dang-Vu , assistant professor and a Concordia Research Chair joked,  I put people to sleep.  He s a leader in the field of sleep study. Following the ceremony, guests had the chance to mix and mingle with honourees, department chairs, colleagues, friends and family.  We hold many events throughout the year to honour our students, but none of our students  success would be possible without the exceptional staff and faculty we have here,  said Roy.  Tonight is to honour them. I am pleased to congratulate each of tonight s honourees, and salute their success in the company of their colleagues.

But are there hidden benefits to being bilingual? Research from Concordia reveals a new perk visible in the problem-solving skills of toddlers. The results of a study recently published by the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology show that bilingual children are better than monolinguals at a certain type of mental control, and that those children with more practice switching between languages have even greater skills. Bilingual speakers can thank the sometimes-arduous practice of switching from one language to another for this skill.  This switching becomes more frequent as children grow older and as their vocabulary size increases,  says Diane Poulin-Dubois, a professor in Concordia s Department of Psychology and the study s senior author.  Therefore, the superior performance on these conflict tasks appears to be due to bilinguals  strengthened cognitive flexibility and selective attention abilities as they have increased experience in switching across languages in expressive vocabulary.  Poulin-Dubois and Cristina Crivello, a graduate student with Concordia s Centre for Research in Human Development (CRDH), led a group of researchers* in a longitudinal investigation, which compared bilingual toddlers to their monolingual peers, tracking the tots as they gained greater vocabularies in each of their two languages. For the study, the researchers assessed the vocabularies of 39 bilingual children and 43 monolinguals when they were aged 24 months, and then again at 31 months. During the second assessment, the researchers also had the young participants perform a battery of tasks to test their cognitive flexibility and memory skills.  For the most part, there was no difference between the bilingual and monolingual toddlers,  says Poulin-Dubois, who is also a member of CRDH.  But that changed dramatically when it came to the conflict inhibition test, and the differences were especially apparent in the bilingual toddlers whose vocabulary had increased most.  In this case, conflict inhibition refers to the mental process of overriding a well learned rule that you would normally pay attention to. To assess toddlers  abilities in this domain, Crivello, who undertook the research as part of her master s thesis and is the first author of the study, administered two tests: Reverse categorization  participants were told to put a set of little blocks into a little bucket and big blocks into a big bucket. Then the instructions were switched   big blocks in the little bucket and little blocks in the big bucket. Shape conflict   participants were shown pictures of different sized fruit and asked to name them. Then a new series of images was shown, with a small fruit embedded inside a large one. Toddlers were asked to point to the little fruit. It wasn t surprising to the researchers that the bilingual children performed significantly better on the conflict inhibition tasks than did their monolingual counterparts.  Language switching underlies the bilingual advantage on conflict tasks,  says Crivello.  In conflict inhibition, the child has to ignore certain information   the size of a block relative to a bucket, or the fact that one fruit is inside another. That mirrors the experience of having to switch between languages, using a second language even though the word from a first language might be more easily accessible.  The unique feature of the study was the finding that the more language switching toddlers engaged in, the more it benefitted them. Within the bilingual group of toddlers, those who had amassed a greater number of  doublets    pairs of words in each language, such as dog/chien   performed even better on the conflict inhibition tasks.  By the end of the third year of life, the average bilingual child uses two words for most concepts in his or her vocabulary, so young bilingual children gradually acquire more experience in switching between languages,  says Poulin-Dubois. *Partners in research: This research was supported by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Her lab   which studies fear, reward and memory   is a Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) project with a total value of approximately $375,000 (including cash contributions from Qu bec's Minist re de l' ducation et de l'Enseignement sup rieur and from Concordia, and in-kind contributions from equipment suppliers). What is the goal of your research? Mihaela Iordanova: The research in my lab focuses on understanding the behavioural and neural mechanisms that guide learning about the world around us. We seek to understand what neural circuits are involved in how we come to expect rewarding or fearful events, as well as how we update these expectations in our dynamic environments. Updated memories can be fickle and subject to disruption, so we aim to develop ways to strengthen such recent memories. Sometimes, the stimuli that we base our expectations on are complex mnemonic events, which combine cues from diverse modalities such as a particular place or time. Our work also seeks to understand the nature of such complex memories. What do you hope will be the impact on society and your field of study? MI: Our work examines both fear and reward, and we hope to integrate and better understand the interaction between these opposing motivational states. We seek to uncover which circuits, as opposed to individual brain areas, process reward and fear, as well as provide a novel understanding of their interaction behaviourally and neutrally, something that has remained largely elusive but has attracted much interest in recent times. Indeed, exaggeration in the processing of rewarding events translates to similar exaggerated processing of aversive events, and this has been linked to addiction. The paradigms we use in our work represent animal models of psychopathologies such as addiction, obesity and anxiety. Examining the integration of fear and reward will provide a novel take on the psychological and neural mechanisms of these conditions. Ultimately, we hope to establish behavioural paradigms, which can inform and lead to the development of novel treatments for addiction, obesity and anxiety. Now that you've won a Canada Research Chair (CRC), what next steps do you hope to take?  MI: The CRC will allow the lab to continue our research on fear and reward, but will also provide us with a way to delve into these questions using advanced optogenetic, pharamacogenetic and real-time neural recording techniques. This provides a means to elucidate the neural mechanisms of reward and fear from the cell to the circuit level. Our lab will push the boundaries of the neurobiology of fear and reward expectation, as well as memory formation by integrating theoretical stipulations of learning with neural techniques that prod brain function in real time and examine how alterations in brain function influence information processing.

What better time to celebrate Concordians working in the field of sleep research? Looking at everyone from children to the elderly, Concordia s researchers are studying the patterns, influences and consequences of sleep. Jennifer McGrath: stress and sleep  My research focuses on how sleep impacts heart health and obesity in children   specifically, why poor families have poor health,  says Jennifer McGrath , associate professor in the Department of Psychology and Concordia s inaugural PERFORM Chair in Childhood Preventive Health and Data Science. \"The stress of being poor gets under their skin, literally, and stress seems to make its biggest impact while we're sleeping.\" Here, at the 2015 Chancellor s Builders Dinner, McGrath s discusses how sleep is critical for good health: &amp;nbsp; A new study from September 2015, led by researchers Jinshia Ly, McGrath and Jean-Philippe Gouin from Concordia s Centre for Clinical Research in Health (CCRH) and the PERFORM Centre , shows that poor sleep might explain how stress impacts health in kids.  Getting a good night s sleep might buffer the impact of stress on kids  cortisol level, which is a hormone produced in the adrenal gland to regulate the body s cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems,  says McGrath, also the director of Concordia s Pediatric Public Health Psychology (PPHP) Laboratory .  Long-term exposure to cortisol can put people at risk for health problems, like heart diseases, weight gain and depression.  This study was part of the larger, ongoing Healthy Heart Project directed by McGrath. It was made possible by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Operating Grant awarded to McGrath and the Fonds de recherche du Qu bec   Sant  bourse de formation ma trise awarded to Ly. The CIHR funding was renewed and the project is funded until 2020. Thanh Dang-Vu: ageing and sleep What is the relationship between sleep and cognition in older adults? Neurologist Thanh Dang-Vu , assistant professor in the Department of Exercise Science, is currently recruiting people over the age of 65 for a sleep study to get some answers.  Thanh Dang-Vu:  Sleep becomes more fragile as you age and the prevalence of insomnia increases.   Sleep becomes more fragile as you age and the prevalence of insomnia increases,  says Dang-Vu, Concordia Research Chair in Sleep, Neuroimaging and Cognitive Health at Concordia s Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology and the PERFORM Centre, is also a medical doctor at the Institut universitaire de g riatrie de Montr al .  In the general population, chronic insomnia, which is insomnia for more than three months, is about 10 to 15 per cent. In the elderly, people older than 65, insomnia rates can be between 30 and 34 per cent, or one third of the population   at least double that of younger people,  he says.  That's a problem, Dang-Vu explains, because the population is more fragile. Insomniacs have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety. Too often, insomnia is treated with sleeping pills and patients become dependent. Cognition concerns  We ve recruited 20 participants over 65 years of age who take benzodiazepines   like Ativan, Klonopin and Serax, for example   to spend the night at our sleep lab,  says Dang-Vu, who won the 2015 Roger Broughton Young Investigator Award from the  Canadian Sleep Society  in recognition of his significant early career contributions to the field of sleep research in Canada.  We re offering them a treatment called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI),  says Dang-Vu, who wants to see if CBTI will improve their cognition.  If that's the case, it would emphasize the importance of treating insomnia for maintaining good cognitive function with age,  he says.  With age, we have a larger risk of developing memory problems. Sleep might be one of these aspects that help prevent the development of dementia. It s important to look at that.

A Concordia study explores the stigma-fighting power of tablets   and their low-cost benefits for the visually impaired Posted on March 22, 2016 | Version fran aise  Tablet computers offer many of the same benefits while being socially acceptable.  | Photo by Sebastien Wiertz The proportion of older adults with age-related vision loss is estimated to be as high as one in three over the age of 50. In Canada, that s roughly 3.6 million people. Many of these individuals turn to adaptive devices designed to magnify objects and text, but these devices can be prohibitively expensive, uni-functional and bulky. Enter the iPad: a technological device that s relatively cheap, serves many purposes, is smaller than most books, and   according to new research from Concordia   is just as effective a visual aid as traditional devices. A study recently described in Good Times Magazine provides the first experimental evidence that the Apple iPad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment. And that could help with stigmatization of the elderly and disabled. For the study, the Concordia-based research team recruited 100 participants who ranged in age from 24 to 97. A little over half the participants had age-related macular degeneration, a disease characterized by the deterioration of the small central portion of the retina that is normally responsible for fine detailed vision tasks such as reading. The researchers used questionnaires and tests to gauge participants  visual ability, and then compared the Apple iPad versus two traditionally used magnification devices, to see if reading rates varied across devices.  Unsurprisingly, we found that most participants found it hard to read small and medium text, while nearly a quarter of them reported that reading large text was much easier,  says Elliott Morrice, an MA student in Concordia s Department of Psychology and the study s first author.  What was interesting to note was that it didn t matter what technology was used to do the magnification: an iPad worked just as well as a traditional device like a closed circuit television system (CCTV),  he says.  When we took previous experience into account, we found that participants who had used iPads before read on average 30 words per minute faster than those who were using the iPad for the first time. But there were no significant differences in the reading rates of participants who had previous experience using the CCTV, compared to the reading rates of first-time CCTV users.  Another benefit is that many older adults feel stigmatized by using the traditional devices, because they identify them as having an impairment or disability.  Tablet computers offer many of the same benefits while being socially acceptable,  says Aaron Johnson , the study s senior author, and an associate professor in the psychology department, and a member of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal (CRIR).   What s more, compared to the devices currently used by those with low vision, iPads are multi-functional, allowing the user to go online, check email, make video calls   and they cost less than the traditional devices,  he says.  This cost saving can be both to the individual, and if appropriate, to the insurance companies that may provide individuals with assistive devices.

Ryder Is Denmark the happiest country in the world? | Photo by Giuseppe Milo (Flickr CC) According to the 2016 World Happiness Report , Denmark is (once again) the happiest country in the world, and thus we should study their society closely to see what they're doing right ... But is it that simple? Here, Andrew G. Ryder , associate professor and director of clinical training in Concordia s Department of Psychology , evaluates the methodology behind the fourth edition of the global survey and shines a light on how metrics and indices are at play: For millennia, philosophers, theologians and many others have argued about what constitutes the  good life.  While some thinkers have emphasized objective markers, particularly economic indicators, others have advocated a broader view that encompasses personal and/or collective well-being. Aristotle s eudaimonia is not merely happiness as maximizing positive emotions, but encompasses wisdom, personal virtue and so on. Social scientists have joined the fray in recent decades. Beyond the GDP The rankings, and the accompanying report, have several advantages. First, the coverage of the study is impressive, and considers most countries in the world   ranging from Denmark (top rank) to Burundi (bottom rank). Second, the resulting index and rankings help move the debate beyond economic indicators. This encourages societies to evaluate policies in terms of their impact on the well-being of their citizens, not merely on whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is increased. Of course, it may well be good to increase GDP, but we could then judge the benefits of such an increase in terms of their impact on human-centred goals, rather than treating economy-centred goals as ends in themselves. Third, the approach taken in this survey was to ask respondents to rank their relative position on a 10-rung ladder from  the best possible life for you  down to  the worst possible life for you.  This method is a marked improvement from older cross-national surveys that used rating scales to measure  happiness  levels. Fourth, the end results are easy to understand, communicate and discuss, helping to fuel a debate about what really matters both within and across different societies. Assumptions behind the numbers  My major concern with these kinds of studies   with the straightforward presentation of national \"league tables\" and their seeming ease of interpretation   is that there are a lot of assumptions buried in these numbers. The authors themselves do an admirable job of covering many concerns, exceptions, interpretive challenges and so on in their report   but the number of people who will read the report will surely be dwarfed by the number of people who read the news coverage and quickly look up their own country s standing. But is happiness actually the end goal against which we would want to evaluate all other goals? What if certain kinds of wisdom make us less happy, but better in other ways? What if happiness within a country is boosted at the expense of happiness in a neighbouring country, or if present happiness is being boosted at the expense of future generations? Complicating matters further, it s not entirely clear that happiness is the best word to use. Unlike many previous studies, the word happiness is not actually used in the main task, which assesses self-perceived quality of life. This approach represents a methodological advance in many ways, but it does complicate the interpretation: the jump to happiness, to the high arousal positive emotional state signified by the English word  happiness  is not straightforward. Cross-national comparisons These kinds of problems are inevitably compounded by cross-national comparisons, especially when people shaped by different cultural contexts respond to the task in different ways. For example, is it possible to raise people s self-perceived quality of life by lowering expectations, so that one s vision of  the best possible life for you  is constrained? In my field of cultural psychology, we have learned that cross-national comparisons are hampered by the \"reference group effect\" where people in different cultural contexts respond to rating scales by comparing themselves with their perception of average people living in their own local environment. Cultural psychologists have also found that people in different cultural contexts vary in terms of which emotional states are most desirable in the first place: whereas many Americans place a premium on  the pursuit of happiness,  many people living in East Asian societies show a marked preference for low arousal positive emotions such as  tranquility.  There is even evidence from Russia showing that people can even value negative emotions as more useful, as more authentic, as part of a richly lived life. Beware of national stereotypes about emotions Another problem with these sorts of cross-national analyses is that subgroup differences are masked. I can just about believe a single score to represent Luxembourg, but what does a single score for China or India even mean? Should we really average Tibet s happiness into China s overall score? These are vast countries with considerable regional diversity, not to mention ethnic, religious, urban-rural and many other important distinctions. To be fair, the authors are admirably clear about this issue, noting that there are wide discrepancies across various groups within each country. But the average reader is likely to miss these points and focus instead on the rankings. We are then a short distance from aggregate  happiness  scores to national stereotypes about emotions. A conclusion such as:  Denmark s sociocultural, political, and economic situation has helped it to become a country where many people rate themselves as at or close to the best life they can imagine for themselves,  becomes:  Danes are the happiest people in the world!  Alternate indices, different results  So I am pleased to see that this ambitious study is helping to move the discussion about national priorities beyond GDP, but hope the discussion continues to move beyond happiness rankings. Remember, we could change the survey question to reflect a different view of happiness, or change the criteria to yield different rankings. We could decide that societies should be judged on the happiness of the poorest 10 per cent, or the happiness of the most disadvantaged demographic subgroup or the ratio of happiness to environmental footprint, etc. There are numerous alternative indices that could help get us beyond GDP, each one with particular assumptions, and each one of which would yield somewhat different results.

About one in 68 children in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Their parents consistently report greater stress levels, caregiving burden and depression than parents of typically developing children. Chronic caregiving stress has also been associated with poorer physical health   more pain, more disruptions from physical-health problems and lower overall health-related quality of life. One powerful way to reduce their stress: social support. That s according to a new study published in Family Relations by researchers from Concordia. And that support is essential as children   and their parents   age. It could also have important consequences for health costs. For the study, psychology professors Jean-Philippe Gouin and Erin T. Barker , as well as their co-authors, investigated whether social support can protect against stress-induced immune problems. They asked 56 healthy parents of children with ASD to complete questionnaires on formal social support (provided by health or social services professionals), informal social support (provided by significant others, friends and family) as well as self-rated health and recent somatic symptoms. Study participants also provided blood samples to check for inflammation   the automatic reaction of the innate immune system upon exposure to infection, injury or abnormal cells, or psychological stress. Chronic low-grade inflammation is also associated with greater risk for several age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, certain cancers, autoimmune diseases, frailty, dementia and early mortality. The results indicated that greater informal social support was associated with lower inflammation, and that a higher number of formal support services received by the family was related to better self-rated health and lower inflammation. Notably, the impact of support services on the parents  inflammation levels increased with the age of the affected child.  The impact of chronic caregiving stress on health likely becomes more pronounced as the parents are aging and their immune system responds less efficiently to challenges,  says Gouin.  The need for formal and informal support thus remains high even as the child with ASD is becoming an adult.  He adds that the study results emphasize the need for continued services for these families, who are experiencing lifelong parenting challenges.  Given the reciprocal relationship between child and parental health and well-being, supporting the parents in coping with chronic caregiving stress might not only improve the child s outcome, but also may help maintain an optimal family environment for a longer period of time. Supporting the parents in providing care to their children with ASD might then represent a cost-effective strategy in the long-term.  Gouin is now continuing this research by following families during their ASD-affected children s last years of high school and the first few years after graduation to examine the impact of social support services on parental health. Currently, 120 families are participating, but Gouin hopes to recruit 100 more in the next two years.

What and how we think about genes, he opened, can be distorted by people believing in something he calls  essences    invisible, inherent forces at play   and projecting those essentialist biases onto genetics. For example, when a transplant recipient thinks they inherited traits of the donor.  People the world over are essentialist thinkers,  he said.  They are attracted to the idea that hidden essences make things as they are. And because genetic concepts remind people of essences, they tend to think of genes in ways similar to essences. That is, people tend to think about genetic causes as immutable, deterministic, homogenous, discrete and natural.  Heine went on to examine how essentialist biases lead people to think differently about sex, sexual orientation, race, ancestry, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), crime, eugenics and disease whenever these are described in genetic terms.  Our essentialist biases make people vulnerable to the sensationalist hype that has emerged with the genomic revolution and access to direct-to-consumer genotyping services,  concluded Heine, who recommends more genetic education for the general public to reduce essentialist thinking and counteract the idea that genetic causes are inevitable.

Concordia student Meagan Boisse investigates Posted on May 12, 2016 | By: Meagan Boisse Am I missing something? What is it with the number 13? | Photo by Angela Rutherford (Flickr CC) Meagan Boisse is a journalism undergraduate. She currently writes A Concordian abroad , a column about her term at the Danish School of Media and Journalism. Tomorrow is Friday the 13th, commonly accepted as the unluckiest day of the year for anyone who isn t a serial killer . While many scoff at the superstitious occasion, some 17 to 21 million people in the United States reportedly suffer from \"friggatriskaidekaphobia,\"  the clinical term for being spooked by this most freaky of Fridays. Why are we afraid? In 2004, the North Carolina Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute estimated the United States loses $800 to 900 million in business on Fridays that coincide with the 13th day of the month, as superstitious consumers are too terrified to go about their daily lives.  You just need enough people talking about something in a scary enough way to then become apprehensive about it yourself,  says Adam Radomsky , a professor of psychology at Concordia .  Once that happens it s very easy not only to worry, but also to tie all minor negative events that could happen at any given time to the superstition.  Val rie De Courville Nicol , a professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology , says society s need for control and catharsis is part of Friday the 13th.  I think that in contemporary culture we have a particularly strong fear of anything that is uncertain, uncontrollable and unpredictable,  she says.  We live in a control-oriented culture, so we don't have much tolerance for irrational phenomena. It's almost as if this day is a culturally legitimate day during which people can express the feelings they can't let themselves express normally. It s a ritualized relationship that has a function in allowing people to put their fears somewhere.  But De Courville Nicol believes that being afraid is not always a bad thing.  You can understand it from a psychological perspective as an irrational fear, but many of the fears that we share in common as a group help produce our identity and our feeling of belonging.  The origin of Friday the 13th Folklorists aren t exactly sure where the most feared date in history comes from . No written evidence for the superstition exists prior to the 19th century. The working theory is that Friday the 13 is actually the product of two separate fears working in tandem. The first is the fear of the number 13 , and the second is the Christian-rooted superstition that Fridays are unlucky, stemming from the belief that it was the day of Crucifixion. As far as the number 13 goes, people have seemingly always been wary of it. Even the Babylonians omitted it from their Code of Hammurabi . Numerologists suspect this could be because it is an outlier of the number 12, thought to be the representation of completeness and perfection. Think about it: 12 apostles of Christ, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 gods of Olympus, 12 zodiac signs, 12 months in a year, 12 hours on the clock. The number has also been spoiling dinner parties for the last few millennia. It is believed that if 13 people dine together, at least one will die within the year. This harkens back to biblical times, as Judas was the 13th person to sit at Christ s table for the last supper   and we all know how that turned out. Fun fact: in the 1880s a society, dubbed the Thirteen Club , was formed to dispel the aforementioned superstition. Members threw 13-people dinner parties on the 13th of every month, and liked to walk under ladders. Five U.S. presidents were honorary members: Chester Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. A not-fun fact? Two were shot, one fatally...

On May 19, the third annual PERFORM Centre Research Conference focuses on prevention and health research Posted on May 16, 2016 | By: J. Latimer Bioimaging is a relevant public health topic, Karen Li says,  because it helps with early diagnosis.  If you think your weight divided by the square of your body height is a reliable indication of your overall health and fitness, think again.  The bathroom scale and your BMI (body mass index) aren t accurate enough because they don t differentiate between somebody with muscle mass and someone with body fat,  says paediatrician Wei Shen, an associate director at the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center at Columbia University. Shen is one of six speakers at the third annual PERFORM Centre Research Conference at Concordia on Thursday, May 19. This year s theme is  Bioimaging for Prevention and Health Research,  and will include presentations on brain imaging, body composition, medical and musculoskeletal imaging. Why bioimaging?  The timing is right for this topic because of significant developments at PERFORM this year,  says  Karen Li , chair of the PERFORM Centre s Scientific Events and Communications Committee and a professor in the Department of Psychology .  Our imaging suite recently opened, and we recently welcomed Habib Benali, PERFORM s new associate scientific director of biomedical engineering. It s quite a coup for Concordia to have Professor Benali here given his international reputation.  At the conference, Benali and PERFORM research member Jean-Paul Soucy will be showcasing current imaging projects led by PERFORM members. The conference's international list of guest speakers  includes: Pedro Antonio Valdes-Sosa from Cuba, Kirsi A. Virtanen from Finland, Alan Evans from Montreal, Julie Hides from Australia, Timothy J. Hall and Shen from the USA.  Their lectures will cover a wide range of subjects because bioimaging has such a diverse application. We have someone talking about elite athletes and astronauts, someone talking about neuro-degeneration and another talking about image-based biomarkers,  says Li. Bioimaging and obesity research Bioimaging is a relevant public health topic, Li says,  because it helps with early diagnosis.  Which brings us back to Shen s research on obesity.  Recent advances in MRI and MRS made it possible to quantify total body and regional fat, to map fat tissue distribution and to evaluate fat in places like the liver and pancreas,  she explains.  The digitalization and centralization of these images allowed for clarifying obesity-related questions in various diseases. Imaging offers enormous opportunities in obesity care and prevention in diseases.  New methodology workshop On Friday, May 20, the day after the bioimaging conference, the PERFORM Centre will host its first Methodological Workshop in Imaging at Concordia s Loyola Campus, with a theme of  Longitudinal Analysis with Neuroimaging Data.  The workshop provides an opportunity to learn new methods special to longitudinal neuroimaging studies. There will be a series of five talks from experts who will introduce longitudinal studies involving different neuroimaging modalities (MRI, fMRI, PET, EEG), while focusing on specific methods to analyse that data. Good prognosis To date, more than 200 people are registered to attend the annual conference and learn more about how bioimaging can serve preventive healthcare. Will they be comparing their BMIs? Not likely. The third annual PERFORM Centre Research Conference begins at 7:45 a.m. on Thursday, May 19. The Methodological Workshop in Imaging begins at 9 a.m. on Friday, May 20.

At least one in four Canadians will have an anxiety disorder in their lifetime. While effective therapies for these often-debilitating disorders exist, many sufferers find them very difficult to engage with or complete. This prompted researchers at Concordia to look for ways to make treatment easier to handle for those who need it most. In studies recently published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders and forthcoming in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Concordia psychology researchers Hannah Levy and Adam Radomsky show that the very behaviours people use to avoid anxiety could become part of an effective treatment, and that patients have a significant role to play in deciding when those behaviours are no longer necessary. Radomsky and Levy focus on safety behaviours   things people do to make themselves feel less anxious. Examples include wearing gloves when touching dirty objects, avoiding eye contact during stressful interactions, distracting yourself when doing something scary   any behaviour that increases feelings of safety in anxiety-provoking situations.  Traditionally, psychologists thought that fading out or eliminating these behaviours entirely should be the primary focus of the therapy used to combat anxiety disorders. But we found that changing those behaviours and giving patients greater agency is much more effective,  says Radomsky, professor in Concordia s Department of Psychology and senior author of the studies. He and Levy followed 157 study participants   ranging from people with low-level anxieties to those diagnosed OCD   as they adapted old habits with new ones that they could use to avoid anxiety during exposure therapy, in which the therapist exposes the patient to feared objects or situations without any danger. The researchers found that using new safety behaviours during exposure therapy was slightly more helpful to participants than their usual or typical safety behaviours. They also found that the most important aspect of reducing the use of safety behaviours in therapy is that the client or patient be the one who decides when they are ready to move forward without them.   This is different from the standard approach in which therapists encourage people to drop their safety behaviours at the outset of the therapy, which often leads people to drop out or refuse the treatment. Under the right conditions, safety behaviours have the potential to make the therapy more effective, and more acceptable,  explains Levy, who recently defended her PhD in psychology at Concordia and will graduate this summer. Radomsky, who also holds a Concordia University Research Chair in Anxiety and Related Disorders, says the results of the research could help therapists shape their approach to best help each person with whom they re working.  It s our hope that these findings will help to reduce the number of people who refuse or drop out of cognitive behavioural therapies and should result in more people getting the help that they need.

Concordia researchers explain how fancy glassware and the sight of a liquor store can facilitate alcohol addiction Posted on May 25, 2016 | Version fran aise  Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues.  | Photo by Photholic (Flickr CC) Humans aren t much different from other animals. Just like Pavlov s dogs , we can become conditioned to associate environmental cues with rewards. Innocent enough when the sight of your sneakers makes you want to go for a run, but not necessarily so when the sight of the liquor store prompts you to want a drink. Indeed, Pavlovian cues that predict alcohol can lead us toward addiction. And sometimes those cues can become desirable in and of themselves, as shown in a new study by Concordia researchers, published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience .  Alcohol addiction is compounded by our ability to learn about predictive cues,  says Nadia Chaudhri , the study s lead author and professor in the Department of Psychology .  Conditioned reactions to those cues can trigger behaviours that result in drinking, like turning into the SAQ or reaching for a beer.  The results of the study suggest that cues that predict alcohol can become highly desirable; therefore, people may keep drinking because of the pleasure derived from our interactions with them. According to this research, drinkers wishing to make a change in their habits shouldn t just focus on the booze itself, but on all the factors that surround alcohol consumption.  Many people have specialized glassware for different kinds of drinks, and strong preferences for what they drink,  Chaudhri explains.  These preferences could be driven by the sensory properties of alcohol, like its taste, smell and how it looks. It is important for people to realize that drinking alcohol is a complex behaviour, and in addition to what alcohol does to our brains, it also plays a role in regulating our behaviours.  For the study, Chaudhri and her co-authors, former Concordia student Chandra Srey and postdoctoral researcher Jean-Marie Maddux , worked with 25 lab rats who were conditioned to associated a specific cue with the presence of ethanol   the main kind of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks. The researchers paired a visual cue with the ethanol so that rats would come to expect alcohol every time they saw that cue. Eventually, when the cue was presented, rats approached the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. But after a time they stopped performing this behaviour and instead began approaching and interacting with the cue. This happened even though the rats gained nothing by playing with the cue, and would actually have been better served by approaching the location where alcohol was about to be delivered. The researchers also noted that the rats would work to earn presentations of a cue that was previously paired with alcohol, even when alcohol was not dispensed along with that cue. These results suggest that a cue that predicts alcohol can become highly desireable. So how can rat behaviour help explain human addiction?  Lots of our behaviours are governed by fundamental learning mechanisms that are also present in other animal species,  says Chaudhri.  By modelling these behaviours in rats we can better understand the factors that control how these behaviours are acquired and maintained in humans.  She explains that we can use animal models to figure out ways to minimize unwanted behaviours like responding to cues that predict alcohol.  This knowledge can then be brought back to the clinic, where we can test similar strategies in humans,  says Chaudhri.  Rat models can also be used to inform us of the brain mechanisms that are important for behaviour. These basic science studies provide a critical foundation for the development of treatments for disorders like alcohol abuse and addiction.  Chaudhri will soon present the results of this and other related studies at the upcoming Society for Quantitative Analyses of Behavior annual symposium taking place May 27 to 28 in Chicago.

On June 17 and 18, alumni of the Centre will return to Concordia for A Night at the Oscar, a monumental retrospective variety show at the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall. How it all began The CAHD was officially created in 1996, but the catalyst for it occurred in 1993 when Lenore Vosberg, a social worker at the West Montreal Readaptation Centre, approached Concordia s Stephen Snow , then a professor of theatre and currently an associate professor of drama therapy and chair of the Department of Creative Arts Therapies, about staging a play with her clients.  It was magical, it just came together. People were astounded. That first play founded a 20-year tradition for the Centre,  says Snow, who recently became the first recipient of the Ella Amir Award for Innovations in Mental Health.* Every second year, the CAHD accepts 20 people with developmental disabilities referred by social workers at readaptation centres and CLSCs. Students come Mondays and Fridays for two years. At the end of their second year, they host a big public outreach event, usually a play. The group comes back on Wednesdays for a third and final year   the denouement, if you will. Ethnodramas and 100 original songs  The theme of our show is 'We Can',  says Lenore Vosberg, the CAHD executive director.  The song 'I Can' was from And Alice Dreams ... and we're expanding it to be 'We Can,' which will be our closing number. We have a core group of singers and behind them there will be everybody else, around 65 people, doing sign language for the lyrics.  Part of A Night at the Oscar will be dedicated to honouring the music of Shelley Snow, who has composed more than 100 original songs during her time as the Centre's music therapist. The CAHD has been at the forefront of using ethnodramas   plays based on the performers' lived experiences   as therapy. So far three ethnodramas have been produced, all to tremendous acclaim.   Stephen Goulet performed in 2012's  Our World: A Musical Ethnodrama  and really enjoyed his experience.  Some days were tough. But with all the bad stuff put aside, I loved every minute of it.  Goulet will also be performing in A Night at the Oscar. They always want me to come back, and I never say no.   Taking everyone for who they are  Choreographing the dance numbers for the retrospective is Gelymar Sanchez, a professional dancer and Concordia psychology student. She first began as a volunteer at the Centre in January 2015,  teaching yoga . Sanchez is working on six dance acts for the show, reshaping original choreography for some and creating others from scratch, each movement designed to suit the dancer.  It's about taking everyone for who they are and for their abilities, rather than their disabilities,  she says.  They keep on surprising me and renewing my vision of dance. Some of the participants are so talented, I feel they are five times better than the best professional dancers I've worked with before. They really blow my mind.  From the stage to the big screen The Centre's story is one that has resounded strongly with people far and wide. CBC made a documentary in 2000 about the CAHD play And Alice Dreams... called Finding Wonderland. In 2011, EyeSteelFilm released the documentary The Frog Princes , about the play The Frog & the Princess .  When CBC came, they were going to come for one day. They got so fascinated by the process, they stayed for two weeks,  says Snow. Because the cast for this year's play is comprised of past participants, the 2014-16 group's public outreach event is an art installation, part of which will be on display in the foyer of the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall during the performance nights. Art pieces will be available for sale. Crafts made by the  participants will also be available for purchase.

As an engineer who also has deep connections in the Faculty of Arts and Science, he will continue to advance PERFORM s role in fostering interdisciplinary research and training collaborations between numerous departments and faculties, as well as with our many inter-institutional research networks.  Benali s research examines how multimodal imaging and computational modelling can be used to better understand which factors promote a healthy lifestyle. The internationally renowned scientist from Paris, who has received multiple distinctions and research awards, brings a wealth of leadership experience to the position. Prior to joining Concordia earlier this year, he served as co-director of the International Laboratory of Neuroimaging and Modelling (LlNeM), a collaboration of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (lNSERM), Universit  Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC, part of the Sorbonne Universities) and Universit  de Montr al. Benali was the head of the Laboratory of Functional Imaging (INSERM U678 unit, France) until 2013, and served as the deputy director of the 110-member Biomedical Imaging Laboratory U1146, INSERM   part of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and UPMC University   until 2015. He looks forward to his new leadership role at Concordia. \"My goal is to develop strong relationships with other research teams generating and fostering preventive health research, and research engineering teams, in particular, on the regional, national and international scene,  he says.  I hope to provide the scientific direction to make the PERFORM Centre a world leader in research, education and community involvement for better health.  Carr says that the leadership team at the centre, which also includes Jean-Paul Soucy, PERFORM associate director of bio-imaging and a professor at McGill University, an outstanding professional staff, and a strong team of department chairs and research scientists who help to execute the vision for PERFORM, will continue to have Concordia s full support as they work to increase the visibility and impact of preventive and healthy lifestyle research.

New Concordia research published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology shows that may be thanks to the hormones that trigger the menstrual cycle.  Women have sometimes reported to doctors that their memory works differently depending on which phase of the menstrual cycle they are in  even during and following pregnancy, or following menopause. This has led scientists to wonder whether estrogen and progesterone could affect memory and problem solving,  says psychology professor Wayne Brake , who co-authored the study.  Our research shows that, rather than impairing memory in general, estrogen and progesterone may instead cause the brain to favour one memory system or strategy over another.    Hormones influence problem-solving For the study, researchers tested 45 women who had regular menstrual cycles. First, participants responded to a  hormonal profile  questionnaire that gathered detailed information on their periods, past pregnancies, contraceptive and synthetic hormone intake history and general life habits. The participants were then given a verbal memory task, such as remembering a list of words, as well as a virtual navigation task, such as finding their way through a maze in a video game, that could be solved in several ways. At the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed on how they solved the tasks from beginning to end. Results were clear: women who were ovulating performed better on the verbal memory task. On the other hand, women tested in their pre-menstrual phase were better at solving spatial navigation tasks. That proves that women tend to use different strategies to solve tasks   such as navigating a maze or remembering a list of words   depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle. Essentially, the study shows that the hormonal changes women experience throughout their cycles have a broader impact than previously believed, and have significant effects on how women approach and solve problems.  This is important scientifically. We and others have previously shown that the levels of estrogen and progesterone in rodents influence different brain regions, affecting various memory systems involved in task-solving,  says Brake.  For example, when estrogen levels are high, female rats will use one type of memory system or strategy versus another to solve a maze. This is the first study to show that this is also true for women, who solve tasks in different ways based on their hormones  'Research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain' For recent PhD graduate Dema Hussain, the study s lead author, these results point to an ongoing bias in scientific research.  Traditionally, researchers and scientists have relied on using male participants   and male rats   in studies to develop drugs and treatments for the general population. But we now know that women respond differently than men,  she says.  I hope that this study emphasizes that more research is needed to deepen our understanding of the female brain, and that efforts must be made to tailor future research to improve our understanding of the effects of female sex hormones on cognition and memory.

Following a successful inaugural season, Beyond Disciplines is back for another year of interdisciplinary discussion and exploration. The public series, created by the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS), examines issues of the day through a variety of perspectives. In 2015 16, topics included gene editing and CRISPR technology , storytelling in research and the future of diversity . The series also spawned a podcast , which is ongoing.  Last year really exceeded our expectations,  says Andr  Roy , dean of FAS.  So, naturally, we want to set the bar even higher.  On Thursday, October 20, the first Beyond Disciplines event of the season,   Come to your senses: Sensescapes in research and in life ,  invites the audience to experience a variety of sensory-themed presentations. Held in collaboration with Concordia s Centre for Sensory Studies, the evening will be hosted by centre co-director David Howes . According to Roy, this year s series won t follow the traditional format of a panel discussion and Q&A.  We really wanted to mix things up and start with something completely different.  Claudine Gauthier is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and one of the upcoming featured speakers. For her, the experience is a rare opportunity to exchange on a topic of research with people from very different fields, and share different perspectives with the public. Gauthier s presentation will discuss how the brain \"sees\" images and how this changes with age.  I will show Magnetic Resonance Imaging pictures of the brain in action during a task, and how we can learn about changes in brain function and aging from these images,  she explains.  Thinking outside the box  Fellow presenter Owen Chapman , associate professor in Communication Studies , will offer an audiovisual experience based on work developed in the Mobile Media Lab that he co-directs.  I will DJ/VJ a short set featuring remixing of both local and distant audio field recordings through an immersive 3D virtual soundscape platform,  says Chapman.  I hope to prompt users to think about the causes and effects of the sounds of one's everyday life.  Another first for Beyond Disciplines this year? Inviting people from outside FAS. Featured panellists in the  Come to your senses  event include Cynthia Hammond , Shauna Janssen and Rhona Richman Kenneally , all from the Faculty of Fine Arts .  I have been investigating the intersections between taste as a sense experience and taste as sanctioned design or style,  explains Richman Kenneally, a professor in the Department of Design and Computation Arts and a fellow in the School of Irish Studies .  I am really looking forward to participating in this event, since my academic training as well as my ongoing research are fundamentally grounded in transdisciplinarity across design and the humanities.  Roy says the series plans to continue thinking outside the box, and promises more surprises as the season unfolds.  We have always said we wanted to explore different forms and formats.

Long afternoons practising scales. All that time you spent in piano lessons and dance classes as a youngster may have seemed like a pain, but new research now confirms what your parents claimed: it s good for mind and body. In fact, a recent study published in NeuroImage by a team* of researchers from the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research, proves that dance and music training have even stronger effects on the brain than previously understood   but in markedly different ways. The researchers used high-tech imaging techniques to compare the effects of dance and music training on the white matter structure of experts in these two disciplines. They then examined the relationship between training-induced brain changes and dance and music abilities.  We found that dancers and musicians differed in many white matter regions, including sensory and motor pathways, both at the primary and higher cognitive levels of processing,  says Chiara Giacosa, PhD candidate in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and the study s lead author. In particular, dancers showed broader connections of fibre bundles linking the sensory and motor brain regions themselves, as well as broader fibre bundles connecting the brain s two hemispheres   in the regions that process sensory and motor information. In contrast, musicians had stronger and more coherent fibre bundles in those same pathways.  This suggests that dance and music training affect the brain in opposite directions, increasing global connectivity and crossing of fibres in dance training, and strengthening specific pathways in music training,  Giacosa explains.  Indeed, while dancers train their whole body, which has a broader representation in the neural cortex, musicians focus their training on some specific body parts, such as hands, fingers or the mouth, which have a smaller cortical representation in the brain.   This work has major potential  Interestingly, dancers and musicians differed more between each other than in comparison to the group of control subjects who had no extensive formal training in either field. According to Giacosa, this can happen because a range of uncontrolled variables influenced the control subjects in different ways, making them more similar to one group or the other.  Contrary to that, our samples of dancers and musicians were specifically selected to be pure groups of experts, which makes it easier to differentiate between them.  Virginia Penhune , professor in Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science and chair of its Department of Psychology , is the study s senior author. She notes that this research deepens the current knowledge about how regions of the brain are connected in networks, and how these structural networks change with training.  This work has major potential for being applied to the fields of education and rehabilitation,  Penhune says.  Understanding how dance and music training differently affect brain networks will allow us to selectively use them to enhance their functioning or compensate for difficulties and diseases that involve those specific brain networks.  Some studies have already shown how music training at a young age can improve various cognitive skills, but dance has yet to be used in a similar way.  Recent research has started to show some improvements with dance and music therapy in patients affected by Parkinson s disease and children with autism respectively, but much more can be done with these and other diseases,  says Penhune. *Partners in research: The co-authors of this study   Chiara Giacosa, Falisha J.

Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, October 7. The recognition comes at the perfect time: five days after 50.2 per cent of voters rejected  a peace agreement with FARC, the oldest and biggest guerrilla group in the world. Today, as a graduate student at Concordia, I can think over what this means for me, for my country and for my academic career. I grew up in an urban context, distant from the day-to-day armed conflict. However, as is true for all Colombians, I grew up knowing that my country was one of the most violent places in the world. That motivated me to conduct research oriented toward informing peace education. When applying to the PhD in Psychology Program at Concordia, I included in my statement of purpose an explanation about how this would be  a secure step toward contributing to knowledge about the healthy development of children in order to meliorate the reality of Colombia and other countries.  I had the fortune to be accepted into the Interpersonal Relationships and Development Laboratory directed by William Bukowski , who has a deep knowledge of Colombian culture and has conducted research there over the last decade. This allowed me to maintain contact with my country, as did the Concordia Graduate Student Mobility Award that I got in 2015. That award allowed me to conduct a summer practice in Colombia, and to contribute to the production of a national report on students  results on citizenship abilities and a document on peace education directed to parents. I have to confess that despite all my purpose as a researcher in training, I was skeptical about seeing the end of the war in Colombia before I died. My hopelessness diminished when it was announced that the government and FARC would sign an agreement of peace, but increased again when I saw that not only had Colombians chosen to decline the referendum but also that 63 per cent of Colombians did not take part in the democratic process.   On Friday morning, thanks to an email from Dr. Bukowski, I found out that Santos was awarded the Nobel Prize, and optimism came back to me. As a supporter of the current agreement, I think that this prize represents pressure on the actors to find a prompt solution. The government, the opposition and FARC leaders will have to find a way to renegotiate the aspects that still need to be revised. The prize committee in Oslo was clear that this recognition is a tool to support Santos and his team in their intention to end a war that has been going on for 50 years. I have to say that on the negative side, Colombians have a culture  of the moment.  We glorify and celebrate while we forget the actual challenges we have to face. The main challenge is to change the minds of thousands of my compatriots who did not treat the peace discussion as a serious topic. I do not mean the people who voted either yes or no in the referendum   I am referring to those who did not participate. But in the face of a deeply divided country, this news brings us hope again.

At what age can children explain people s behaviours as being guided by their mental states? Who do toddlers trust to teach them new things   and why? These questions, and others like it, have been the focus of Diane Poulin-Dubois  s research for the last 31 years at Concordia. The psychology professor from the Faculty of Arts and Science leads the Cognitive and Language Development Lab . On October 18, Poulin-Dubois is being honoured with a career award   the Prix Acfas Th r se Gouin-D carie for social science. The Association francophone pour le savoir (Acfas) hosts the largest multidisciplinary gatherings of research and knowledge in the French-speaking world.  Professor Diane Poulin-Dubois s groundbreaking scholarship in early cognitive and language development is widely esteemed by peers and practitioners,  says Justin Powlowski , interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies at Concordia.  We are delighted to see her receive such prestigious recognition from Acfas for the impact she has made within and beyond academe, nationally and internationally.  This isn t the first time that Acfas has recognized Poulin-Dubois s contributions. In 1996, she won the Prix du meilleur article de vulgarisation scientifique de l ACFAS (faculty award). She was also on the organizing committee when Concordia hosted the 2014 Acfas conference ,  Research: Zones of Creativity and Convergence,   welcoming 5,100 scholars and offering 173 colloquia. Previous Acfas winners from the Concordia community include Michel Laroche , John Molson School of Business marketing professor, Andr  Roy , dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, Sherry Simon , French professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science, Marguerite Mendell , professor and graduate program director for the School of Community and Public Affairs, and Fran ois-Marc Gagnon , founding director of the Gail and Stephen A.

A mentor feels  resurrected   Winning this award has a special sentimental value for me because it was recently renamed after my mentor, Th r se Gouin-D carie,  says Poulin-Dubois.  She is now retired but we talk frequently. She joked that my win has been like a resurrection for her.  This career award has also been gratifying for Poulin-Dubois, who is donating a portion of her $5,000 Acfas prize money to La Fondation du Dr. Julien which provides support to underprivileged children.  We work hard and this is recognition for what we do.  Just last year, her team published a study that proves that toddlers who learned more doublets (for example,  dog/chien ) over a seven-month period were ahead of the monolingual toddlers in executive function. This relates to skills such as planning, inhibition control and self-regulation. Her other recent work is in a relatively new field of social cognition called  trust,  which is the study of how children detect who to believe when acquiring new information.  We already know that preschoolers are more likely to learn from individuals with a history of making accurate claims over individuals who have been inaccurate or ignorant,  says Poulin-Dubois.  My particular contribution and insight is determining the origin of this ability. Which characteristics of the model are they sensitive to? Then you can speculate how our species has evolved differently or similarly to others.  Praise from the department William Bukowski , psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Centre for Research in Human Development , is thrilled that Acfas is recognizing Poulin-Dubois.  Diane has been at the forefront of understanding how the concepts that were popular in a Piagetian perspective can now be applied to other domains of functioning, such as bilingualism,  he says.   She is remarkable in her capacity to develop rigorous and very creative laboratory tests.  Bukowski also points to Poulin-Dubois s success as a supervisor.

At 2 a.m. this Sunday morning, November 6, we will return to standard time by moving our clocks back one hour. This change happens annually on the first Sunday in November   unless you live in most of Saskatchewan, Southampton Island in Nunavut or small pockets of Northwestern Ontario, Quebec or BC. These regions of Canada never opted into Daylight Saving Time (DST), although other cities and regions were using DST as early as 1918. Spring forward, fall back  The extra hour of sleep sounds great, but when we change the time, there's an alteration of the circadian rhythms and that's when the problems start,  says Nuria de Zavalia, a research associate who works with Shimon Amir , a psychology professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and director of the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia. It's like jet lag, she adds, explaining that alterations in the circadian system can affect alertness, mood, stress hormone levels, memory formation, cognitive performance, metabolism, cardiovascular system and, especially, depression.  Daylight Saving Time does not help people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder , for example,  says de Zavalia.  And research has shown that the Monday after the time change   especially in the spring, when we have one hour less sleep   there is an increase in car accidents, heart attacks and depressive episodes .  So, what can be done to lessen the effects of returning to standard time?  Start early,  says de Zavalia.  If you can change the clocks a few days early, in 10-minute increments instead of a full hour in one shot, it ll be easier on your system.

{"url": "https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology/faculty.html?fpid=linda-booij", "body": "linda.booij@concordia.ca Research Interests Numerous studies have shown that adverse exposures in utero or in the first years of life (e.g., emotional or physical abuse, harsh parenting) can lead to a variety of mental health difficulties later on. These difficulties include (but are not limited to) depression, impulsivity or eating disorders.  Early adverse exposures in utero or in the first years of life can affect the brain in many different ways; however, the neurotransmitter serotonin is of particular interest. That is because serotonin is (i) widely implicated in a variety of psychopathologies and (ii) important for brain development, especially during infancy or childhood  (i.e., serotonin, in fact, helps to actually  build up the brain ). The overarching theme of our research program is that early adversity could disrupt the stability of certain brain chemicals (e.g., serotonin). This in turn influences the early development of brain regions involved in emotion regulation, and could predispose the individual to psychological problems later in life, particularly when exposed to subsequent stressful events. The studies we are conducting are done in clinical and non-clinical populations and use neuro-imaging (fMRI/PET), epigenetics (DNA methylation) and/or cognitive-behavioural assessments, and is funded by various sources, including CIHR and NARSAD.  Topics of ongoing research projects include: - Impact of childhood trauma on brain processes and (risk for) mental health problems in adolescence and adulthood. - Effect of cognitive-behavioural interventions on DNA methylation and brain function in adolescents with depression. - DNA methylation, childhood trauma and psychopathology (in particular mood disorders and eating disorders). - Impact of peer victimization on brain development and DNA methylation - Gene-Environment studies on brain and mental health, using twin designs. - Impact of early stress on oral health. - Impact of in utero Bisphenol-A (BPA) exposure on brain development in children Education PhD (Leiden University, the Netherlands) Teaching activities Psychopathology: Mood, Anxiety, and Personality Disorders (Psyc 440, winter 2016 and 2017) Practicum Neuropsychology (2016-2017) Publications Selected recent publications Booij, L., Welfeld, K., Leyton, M., Dagher, A., Boileau, I., Sibon, I., Baker, G.B.,  Diksic, M., Soucy, J-P., Pruessner, J.C., Cawley   Fiset, E., Casey, K.F., Benkelfat, C.(2016).

My work has sought to answer questions pertaining to two distinct yet integrative learning processes:  What are the neural mechanisms that drive association formation between stimuli and in particular the establishment of predictive relationships as informed by error correcting mechanisms?  A complementary question pertains to the nature of the representations that enter into associative relationships.  Thus my second line of research is aimed at understanding how complex stimuli are represented in the brain and in particular how such stimuli can be updated and incorporated into new mnemonic events. My approach to the study of brain and behavior is to combine well-controlled behavioral designs informed by formalized theories of learning and causal (disruptive, modulatory pharmacological and optogenetic methods) and correlational (cell recording) neuroscience techniques.

Biography Mihaela Iordanova completed her undergraduate studies at the University of New South Wales where she was awarded a Bachelor s degree with Honors in Psychology in 2001.  She conducted her doctoral studies on the role of the accumbal opioid and dopamine transmission in error-correction in the fear setting at the same institution under the guidance of R. Frederick Westbrook.  As part of her doctoral research Mihaela visited the laboratory of Simon Killcross at Cardiff University where she embarked on research examining the role of dopamine in predicting fear.  Following completion of her PhD in 2006, Mihaela sought post-doctoral training back in the learning theory hub that is the School of Psychology at Cardiff University.  There she worked with prominent scientists including Rob Honey and Mark Good on the neurocircuitry of mnemonic integration and updating, and forged strong collaborations with John Pearce, John Aggleton, and Dominic Dwyer.  Her desire to study how the neurons change their pattern of firing as a result of environmental stimulation took her across the Atlantic to the laboratory of Geoffrey Schoenbaum. While holding appointments at University of Maryland and at the National Institute of Drug Abuse, she examined how cells in the central nucleus of the amygdala modulate their firing under conditions when fewer than expected rewards are delivered.  Mihaela was awarded a prestigious Pathways to Independence (K99/R00) award from the National Institutes of Health to conduct this work.  In 2014 Mihaela was appointed as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychology where she joins the Centre for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology. Back to top ", "title": "Faculty"},

This suggests that democracy itself is at risk.  One reason for trust's alleged decline is the apparent challenges posed by diversity   ethnic, racial, cultural   in forming and sustaining the trust relations that democracies require to function well. Using the tools provided by political theory, we will subject these common claims to critical analysis.  What is trust, actually?  Is trust (or its supposed opposite, distrust) essential to democratic politics,and in what way?  If so, how can it be protected and nurtured?  Do we have good reason to believe that diversity poses challenges to trust relations in democratic states?  If so, what sort of challenges and can the right sort of public policy mitigate them?

After completing his postdoctoral training with Dr. Yavin Shaham at the National Institute on Drug Abuse/NIH in 2002, he headed the behavioral laboratory in D-Pharm Ltd., Rehovot, Israel. At the same time, he was appointed a senior lecturer at the Academic College Tel Aviv-Yaffo. In 2004 he joined the Department of Psychology and the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology at Concordia University. He held a Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology of Drug Abuse (Tier II; 2004-2015). Research Drug abuse, Relapse, Animal models, Behavioural neurobiology, Eating disorders Overview Using an animal model for drug self-administration, the research in my lab targets the brain mechanisms underlying the strikingly similar behaviors characterizing drug addiction and eating disorders. In addition, I am interested in the effects of early-life experiences on the development of mental disorders, susceptibility to drug abuse and eating disorders in the adult organism. Drug abuse and eating disorders are having an increasing impact on Western Society. New and more effective treatments are only likely to be developed once the interaction between the neural systems that underlie these disorders are understood. My research involves two main themes that are concerned with factors that promote and maintain substance abuse. The first arises from my previous work showing that food deprivation potently induced relapse to heroin and cocaine seeking in laboratory rats, and that this effect is attenuated by leptin, a hormone involved in appetite regulation and energy balance. These data indicate a link between substance abuse and eating control mechanisms. We use a model of food-restriction-induced relapse to drugs in rats that is based on the drug self-administration procedure. We then examine the brains of the manipulated rats in search of the mechanisms underlying the behavioral phenomena. The second theme is concerned with the often-reported comorbidity of drug abuse with mental disorders, and more specifically, eating disorders. We are using activity-induce anorexia as a model for anorexia nervosa to study factors that affect vulnerability to drugs and natural rewards and identify changes in underlying neuromechanisms.

A new memory requires the formation of a memory trace, or \"engram\", in the brain. First, the hippocampus and other nearby cortical areas are thought to integrate sensory inputs into a cohesive representation. Then, memory is stored more permanently through connections with other parts of the brain including the neocortex. A major mechanism through which circuits of the brain can learn is through long-lasting increases (or decreases) in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. My lab examines how changes in synaptic strength occur in parahippocampal and neocortical regions of the rat. Electrophysiological recording techniques are used to monitor synaptic strength and to examine how neuromodulatory systems (cholingergic, dopaminergic) and rhythmic EEG activities control changes in how neurons interact with one another. Both graduate and undergraduate students make important contributions to this research.

We examine from a self-regulation perspective how people can adjust to challenging life circumstances and prevent the adverse consequences on their psychological, biological, and physical health (e.g., depression, cortisol dysregulation, or chronic disease). This research program integrates theories from personality, developmental, and health psychology, and is based on the premise that there are reliable individual differences in people s personality processes that determine the quality of life of individuals who confront problematic life situations.

An area of interest involves designing instruments to measure lifetime          changes in psychological characteristics in order to examine the impact          of those experiences on competence in old age. Although the technique          for measuring lifetime changes was first developed for alcohol use, currently          it is being used to measure lifetime stress experiences. My current research          examines the interplay of stress and coping from a lifetime perspective.

Miceli Acts of terror are everywhere. Not one day goes by without hearing about the latest suicide bomb in Baghdad, knife stabbing in Germany, or shooting spree in France or in the United States. A Christian extremist preacher claims that homosexuals deserve to die because he considers their lifestyle to be sinful; groups like ISIS perpetrate genocide against religious minorities and call for global jihad against infidels; Buddhist monks in Myanmar persecute the Rohingya for fear that the Muslim minority destroy their country and religion. All these actions seem to be somehow religiously motivated, where the actors claim to act in accordance with their beliefs. In the midst of this spiral of violence seen across traditions and geographical locations, there is a pressing need to understand why people act as such in the name of their faith. The Global Impact of Religious Violence examines why individuals and groups sometimes commit irremediable atrocities, and offers some solutions on how to counter religiously inspired violence. \"The essays in this book explore the controversial thesis that religion itself leads to violence, rather than simply being used to justify the actions of angry activists. Though many will argue with this assumption, it contributes to the ongoing discussion about the role of religion in the violent encounters of contemporary public life.\" --Mark Juergensmeyer, author of Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence Andr  Gagn  is a tenured associate professor in the Dept. of Theological Studies at Concordia University (Montreal).

The malleability of memory, hypnosis and hypnotizability, and the scientificity of some clinical concepts linked to memory and consciousness. Distortions and creations of memories are particularly relevant to our understanding of day to day memory, experience and self-consciousness. This research has important implications in the legal (eye-witness testimonies, autobiographical memories, expert testimony), and clinical (causal attributions of current symptoms) contexts. We seek to better understand the factors at play when an individual attempts to remember real life events. Individual factors, like suggestibility and hypnotizability, social-psychological factors (beliefs, expectations) and cognitive factors like one s attentional and perceptual networks are some of the factors that we believe important in understanding the construction of memories. A second area of research investigates the different aspects of hypnotizability and hypnosis. What makes an individual hypnotizable? Why do individuals respond differently to a hypnotic induction? What is the role of volition in hypnotic and non-hypnotic responses? How can hypnotic behaviours and experiences inform us on conscious and non-conscious processes? A final area of interest is the theoretical evaluation of the scientificity of psychological concepts that are commonly used in lay and professional contexts.  Examples of these are consciousness and non-consciousness, volition, intuition, repression, dissociation, body memories, etc. The common thread relating these three areas is the evaluation of the role of non-conscious processes, proximal (attentional processing) and distal (beliefs), in the elicitation of overt behaviours and experiences.

This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract Every year, indoor air pollution is responsible for the premature death of millions of people worldwide. This fact highlights the importance of improving indoor air quality (IAQ) in in areas including sustainable buildings. Among different air pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) constitute a major part of indoor pollutants. The proven negative impact of these compounds in occupants  health has motivated researchers to develop different air treatment technologies for the removal of VOCs. Development of plasma-based methods, and their remarkable capabilities for VOCs degradation, has motivated designers to employ these methods as indoor air purification. It has been demonstrated that utilizing a dual functional adsorbent/catalyst (DFA/C) in a plasma system can significantly enhance the VOCs removal and energy efficiency of such an air purifier. However, selecting an appropriate DFA/C is a challenge to achieve the best performance in these systems. For the first time, this research attempted to utilize metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as DFA/Cs for a plasma-driven catalytic reactor. Accordingly, three different MOFs, MIL-101 (MIL: Metal institute Lavoisier), MIL-53, and CPM-5 (CPM: Crystalline Porous Material-5), were synthesized through microwave, solvothermal and mechanochemical methods. To test the performance of these DFA/Cs, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) system was designed and implemented as a non-thermal plasma (NTP) set-up. During preparation and evaluation experiments, different characterization and analytical instruments, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), BET surface area analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas Chromatogram/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS), Ozone monitor, and VOC Photoionization detector (PID), were utilized. Several adsorption and oxidation experiments were conducted to study physical and chemical behaviors of MOFs for the removal of one (1) ppm toluene and isobutanol on MIL-101, MIL-53 and CPM-5. Also, the effect of the presence of 30% relative humidity on the adsorption capacity and oxidation ability of each MOF was investigated. Results showed physisorption of VOCs on all MOFs during the course of adsorption tests. Moreover, the stable structure of the examined MOFs before and after plasma-catalytic reactions indicated a facile regeneration of catalysts. During the plasma-catalytic oxidation of toluene and isobutanol, different organic by-products and ozone were detected either in dry or humid conditions for all MOFs. MIL-101 and MIL-53 exhibited much higher adsorption and oxidation ability compared to CPM-5 in most of the experiments. Results demonstrated a higher adsorption capacity and almost the same oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 compared to MIL-53 in dry air. Nevertheless, the negative influence of humidity on adsorption and oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 was more significant than in MIL-53. In conclusion, results demonstrated the potential capacity of MOFs as DFA/Cs in a NTP system.

Abstract: What is schizophrenia? Schizophrenia manifests differently in different cultures, according to different modes of understanding. Modern scientific understandings of the disease categorize it as a neurological disorder, primarily biological or genetic in nature, with the experience of the disease manifesting in the  split mind(s)  (schizo- phr ne) of patients. But there is mounting empirical evidence to suggest that biogenetic and neurologically reductive approaches are limited with respect to their treatment outcomes, and   as I argue   specifically alienating to patients. Patients are faced both with social alienation, and a sense of alienation from self   I argue that this is primarily by the disease s interaction with its cultural and political situatedness, rather than by the manifestation of disease itself. Leaning on Marx and Foucault, I seek to readdress the question of schizophrenic ontology in this essay, motivating for a model that will attenuate the experience of alienation thought symptomatic of schizophrenia by approaching it as dialectical co-production of both biogenetic, and sociocultural factors. The result is to argue for the irreducibility of the experience of vulnerability in future research seeking to open up treatment options for patients with schizophrenia.

EN For over three decades, the annual undergraduate exhibition has presented works by students in the Faculty of Fine Arts at Concordia University. In recent years, the initiative has expanded to include writers from the department of Art History and designers from the department of Design and Computation Arts. Together, a uniquely designed catalogue illustrates the diversity of works and texts that reveal the breadth of talent found within the faculty of fine arts. We are pleased to introduce a new layer to this year s iteration and are working with performers from Concordia s department of Contemporary Dance. As such, the growing collaboration has compelled us to come up with a theme to unify the participating disciplines. The thematic of  space  was introduced to encourage thought-provoking concepts that stem from notions of space, which has the potential to be interpreted broadly within various creative practices. For example, there is the space between generations, pictorial space, the space between performer and audience, geographic space, queer space, political space, outer space, to name only a few. The FOFA Gallery salutes the extraordinary work of the artists, writers, designers and dancers proving that cross-disciplinary practice continues to be an engaging approach within the creative process. We also wish to acknowledge the dedicated guidance from professors in all of these departments who have inspired a dynamic illustration of current interests and artistic explorations.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract This thesis collects three articles that explore the construct of reflected appraisal  individuals  beliefs about how they are seen in the eyes of others. These manuscripts are linked by the overarching question  How do employees manage the bombardment of myriad reflected appraisals in their daily organizational lives?  To address this, the articles examine four workplace manifestations of reflected that are represented by the constructs of perceived supervisor support, organizational support, respect and external prestige (also called image) while considering the referents inherent in each construct (i.e., Co-workers, team members, the employing organization and external stakeholders). The theoretical manuscript (article 1) examines the four reflected appraisals together, asking what contextual and individual factors predict which reflected appraisals employees are more likely to focus on and when. We use employees  work-roles as the key construct that links these factors together, arguing that self-motives drive individuals to focus on some reflected appraisals under the constraint of accountability and interdependence that are part of the organizational structure. The quantitative manuscript (article 2) examines the concurrent impact of respect and prestige on relational and organizational identification. In a survey of student-athletes from varsity sports teams, we found that the matching principle prevailed: Prestige and respect that are focused on the relationship predicted relational identification while respect and prestige focused on the collective predicted organizational identification. However, prestige was the better predictor of both the relational and organizational foci. The qualitative manuscript (article 3) focuses on organizational image and explores how individuals respond to perceived organizational stigma. I interviewed employees of general contractors during a city-wide scandal in which various audiences marked their organizations as  the enemy  by virtue of their category-membership. I found that interviewees negotiated two images that embodied individuating and de-individuating reflected appraisals of their organization. Furthermore, employees constructed these images using various sources of information that they integrated into their reflected appraisals. Overall, the three articles demonstrate that employees actively engage with a plethora of reflected appraisals from multiple referents in the organizational environment.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract This investigation focuses on research-for-design in two university graphic design programs. Re-search-for-design is defined as a research activity performed by the designer in order to inform the design process. This study aims to better understand the contribution of research-for-design education, not only as a required activity in the design process, but also as a strategy to develop a vision for sustainable design. This comparative study examined two university design programs, the Concordia University in Montreal, Canada and the Universidad Aut noma de San Luis Potos  in San Luis Potos , Mexico. I examined student and teacher accounts of how research is taught in each program. Through a process of comparative analysis, I identified differences in the participating students and educators  backgrounds and design streams which led to varied perspectives of disciplinary practice. Formal and informal methods of doing research-for-design were identified and linked to accounts of teaching and learning. These practices in the education of research-for-design included intuitive, informal, spontaneous, ludic, innovative, visual, creative, social, and emphatic strategies. Teaching research-for-design demands an effective way to connect students with their entire environment. By doing this, the education of research-for-design will empower students  understanding of the design process with the potential to promote ethical, sustainable, comprehensive, and integrative design.

In particular, he will explore the main empirical, analytical, and normative issues related to the challenges multiculturalism entails for citizenship, democracy and justice, and will focus on the modalities through which specific public policies are mobilized, legitimized, and debated in public space. He will also address the implications that such policies have on the recognition / misrecognition of  other , and their normative implications for culturally divided societies.

This suggests that democracy itself is at risk.  One reason for trust's alleged decline is the apparent challenges posed by diversity   ethnic, racial, cultural   in forming and sustaining the trust relations that democracies require to function well. Using the tools provided by political theory, we will subject these common claims to critical analysis.  What is trust, actually?  Is trust (or its supposed opposite, distrust) essential to democratic politics,and in what way?  If so, how can it be protected and nurtured?  Do we have good reason to believe that diversity poses challenges to trust relations in democratic states?  If so, what sort of challenges and can the right sort of public policy mitigate them?

Although we often think of political discourse as rational, literary sources are crucial to democratic politics as they can offer a civic education or way for citizens to think about and understand politics and political debates. Such literary sources are also essential to democratic discourse because they provide a way to engage in politics through critique and protest. Targeting experts from political science, English, comparative literature, classics, history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, and the liberal arts, this workshop will identify crosscutting research areas which explore the important contribution of alternative epistemological approaches to understanding, promoting, and critiquing democratic practices. Within this theme, the one-day event will investigate the state of research on literary approaches to democratic political thought and identify key areas for future research.

March 23, 2017, 12 p.m.   2 p.m. Any time students and professors are engaging with the community on a project, there are many different power dynamics at work. When it comes to more technical or specialized knowledge, the degrees and prestige granted by one s association with a university makes the expert/non-expert dynamic even more pronounced.  Recognizing that, in the interest of mutually beneficial partnerships where the learning flows in all directions, it is important to take steps to breakdown these hierarchies, this community of practice event invites participants to consider what it would take to meaningfully level the playing field. By recognizing the presence and the impact of the academic gaze, what steps can we take to address it?  What participatory practices might enable us to value and integrate less formalized ways of knowing and non-academic expertise? What would change if we modeled these same practices in our classroom? How can we best support our students as they learn to work more collaboratively with their community partners and each other? Together, we will explore what it means to take democracy seriously in space and time. As professors and urban practitioners, how can we become facilitators rather than leaders?

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract This dissertation analyzes the convoluted process by which Irish nationalists, Irish unionists, and British politicians negotiated Irish self-government in the first two decades of the twentieth century. In December 1909, a modest form of self-government known as home rule within the British Empire for all of Ireland became a practical issue in United Kingdom politics again, after the failure of two previous home rule bills in 1886 and 1893. After a decade that witnessed a world war and a revolution in Ireland, two new Irish polities emerged by June 1922. Northern Ireland, a majority-unionist state comprised of six counties in the province of Ulster, acquired a limited form of home rule within the United Kingdom. Covering the rest of the island, the Irish Free State secured significant control of its domestic affairs as a dominion of the British Empire, though not the complete independence demanded by Sinn F in and the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which had waged the revolution. How did the main political parties and actors in Britain and Ireland arrive at this settlement, especially as it was so different from how elites had envisioned Irish self-government in 1909? Using archival material and public discourse, this dissertation seeks to answer this question by methodically analyzing the political decisions taken by British and Irish political parties and movements between 1909 and 1922. It challenges historical conceptions that the settlement enacted by the Government of Ireland Act (1920) and the Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921) was an inevitable evolution in Anglo-Irish relations, that it marks the British government s recognition of the Irish right to self-determination, or the triumph of Irish democracy. Instead, I argue that the settlement was highly contingent upon prevailing political circumstances, heavily influenced by British interests, and often defied the democratic demands of Irish people, both nationalist and unionist. Partition, the separation of Ireland into two different states, was achieved through the acquiescence of British politicians to the demands of Ulster unionist leaders, without reference to public opinion in any part of Ireland.

Kristin is on the board of directors of the  Borneo Orangutan Society Canada , and the author of two books on the philosophy of animal minds. Abstract: Traditionally, discussions of moral participation   and in particular moral agency   have focused on fully formed human actors. There has been some interest in the development of morality in humans, as well as interest in cultural differences when it comes to moral practices, commitments, and actions. However, until relatively recently there has been little focus on the possibility that nonhuman animals have any role to play in morality, save being the object of moral concern. Moreover, when nonhuman cases are considered as evidence of moral agency or subjecthood, there has been a tendency to focus on higher-order moral behaviors (i.e., those same behaviors that inform our views about human moral agency). If we are to understand the evolution of moral psychology and moral practice, then this relative lack of attention to the practices of other animals and this persistent focus on the moral instead of the normative have been great oversights. A biologically responsible way of examining the distribution of moral practice in other animals starts from considering the distribution of normative practice across species. Drawing on the work of psychologists and anthropologists, the normative foundations of morality across humans demonstrates that some animals chimpanzees and cetaceans in particular demonstrate many of the moral foundations that indicate the existence of a cognitive modality I call na ve normativity.

Abstract This thesis contributes and provides solutions to the problem of fault diagnosis and estimation from three different perspectives which are i) fault diagnosis of nonlinear systems using nonlinear multiple model approach, ii) inversion-based fault estimation in linear systems, and iii) data-driven fault diagnosis and estimation in linear systems. The above contributions have been demonstrated to the gas turbines as one of the most important engineering systems in the power and aerospace industries. The proposed multiple model approach is essentially a hierarchy of nonlinear Kalman filters utilized as detection filters. A nonlinear mathematical model for a gas turbines is developed and verified. The fault vector is defined using the Gas Path Analysis approach. The nonlinear Kalman filters that correspond to the defined single or concurrent fault modes provide the conditional probabilities associated with each fault mode using the Bayes  law. The current fault mode is then determined based on the maximum probability criteria. The performance of both Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF) are investigated and compared which demonstrates that the UKF outperforms the EKF for this particular application. The problem of fault estimation is increasingly receiving more attention due to its practical importance. Fault estimation is closely related to the problem of linear systems inversion. This thesis includes two contributions for the stable inversion of non-minimum phase systems. First, a novel methodology is proposed for direct estimation of unknown inputs by using only measurements of either minimum or non-minimum phase systems as well as systems with transmission zeros on the unit circle. A dynamic filter is then identified whose poles coincide with the transmission zeros of the system. A feedback is then introduced to stabilize the above filter dynamics as well as provide an unbiased estimation of the unknown input. The methodology is then applied to the problem of fault estimation and has been shown that the proposed inversion filter is unbiased for certain categories of faults. Second, a solution for unbiased reconstruction of general inputs is proposed. It is based on designing an unknown input observer (UIO) that provides unbiased estimation of the minimum phase states of the system. The reconstructed minimum phase states serve then as inputs for reconstruction of the non-minimum phase states. The reconstruction error for non-minimum phase states exponentially decrease as the estimation delay is increased. Therefore, an almost perfect reconstruction can be achieved by selecting the delay to be sufficiently large. The proposed inversion scheme is then applied to the output-tracking control problem. An important practical challenge is the fact that engineers rarely have a detailed and accurate mathematical model of complex engineering systems such as gas turbines. Consequently, one can find a trend towards data-driven approaches in many disciplines, including fault diagnosis. In this thesis, explicit state-space based fault detection, isolation and estimation filters are proposed that are directly identified from only the system input-output (I/O) measurements and through the system Markov parameters. The proposed procedures do not involve a reduction step and do not require identification of the system extended observability matrix or its left null space. Therefore, the performance of the proposed filters is directly connected to and linearly dependent on the errors in the Markov parameters estimation process. The estimation error dynamics is then derived in terms of the Markov parameters identification errors and directly synthesized from the healthy system I/O data. Consequently, the estimation errors have been effectively compensated for. The proposed data-driven scheme requires the persistently exciting condition for healthy input data which is not practical for certain real life applications and in particular to gas turbine engines. To address this issue, a robust methodology for Markov parameters estimation using frequency response data is developed. Finally, the performance of the proposed data-driven approach is comprehensively evaluated for the fault diagnosis and estimation problems in the gas turbine engines.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract An effective fault detection and isolation (FDI) technology can play a crucial role in improving the system availability, safety and reliability as well as reducing the risks of catastrophic failures. In this thesis, the robust sensor FDI problem of gas turbine engines is investigated and different novel techniques are developed to address the effects of parameter uncertainties, disturbances as well as process and measurement noise on the performance of FDI strategies. The efficiencies of proposed techniques are investigated through extensive simulation studies for the single spool gas turbine engine that is previously developed and validated using the GSP software. The gas turbine engine health degradation is considered in various forms in this thesis. First, it is considered as a part of the engine dynamics that is estimated off-line and updated periodically for the on-board engine model. Second, it is modeled as the time-varying norm-bounded parameter uncertainty that affects all the system state-space matrices and third as an unknown nonlinear dynamic that is approximated by the use of a dynamic recurrent neural network. In the first part of the thesis, we propose a hybrid Kalman filter (HKF) scheme that consists of a single nonlinear on-board engine model (OBEM) augmented with piecewise linear (PWL) models constituting as the multiple model (MM) based estimators to cover the entire engine operating regime. We have integrated the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)-based method with our MM-based scheme to estimate the sensor fault severity under various single and concurrent fault scenarios. In order to ensure the reliability of our proposed HKF-based FDI scheme during the engine life cycle, it is assumed that the reference baselines are periodically updated for the OBEM health parameters. In the second part of the thesis, a novel robust sensor FDI strategy using the MM-based approach is proposed that remains robust with respect to both time-varying parameter uncertainties and process and measurement noise. The scheme is composed of robust Kalman filters (RKF) that are constructed for mul- tiple PWL models. The parameter uncertainty is modeled by using a time-varying norm bounded admissible structure that affects all the PWL state space matrices. The robust Kalman filter gain matrices are designed by solving two algebraic Riccati equations (ARE) that are expressed as two linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibil- ity conditions. The main objective is to propose a robust filter that satisfies the overall performance requirements and is not affected by system perturbations. The requirements include a quadratically stable filter that ensures bounded estimation error variances having predefined values. In the third part of the thesis, a novel hybrid approach is proposed to improve the robustness of FDI scheme with respect to different sources of uncertainties. For this purpose, a dynamic recurrent neural network (DRNN) is designed to ap- proximate the gas turbine engine uncertainty due to the health degradations. The proposed DRNN is trained offline by using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) al- gorithm for an engine with different levels of uncertainty, but with healthy sensors. The convergence of EKF-based DRNN training algorithm is also investigated. Then, the trained DRNN with the fixed parameters and topology is integrated with our online model-based FDI algorithm to approximate the uncertainty terms of the real engine. In this part, the previously proposed HKF and RKF are integrated with the trained DRNN to construct the hybrid FDI structure.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract Many industrial systems are nonlinear with  slow  and  fast  dynamics because of the presence of some  parasitic  parameters. These systems are usually labeled as  singularly perturbed  or  multi-time-scale  systems. Singular perturbation theory has been proved to be a useful tool to control and analyze singularly perturbed systems if the full knowledge of the system model parameters is available. However, the accurate and faithful mathematical models of those systems are usually difficult to obtain due to the uncertainties and nonlinearities. To obtain the accurate system models, in this research, a new identification scheme for the discrete time nonlinear singularly perturbed systems using multi-time-scale neural network and optimal bounded ellipsoid method is proposed firstly. Compared with other gradient descent based identification schemes, the new identification method proposed in this research can achieve faster convergence and higher accuracy due to the adaptively adjusted learning gain. Later, the optimal bounded ellipsoid based identification method for discrete time systems is extended to the identification of continuous singularly perturbed systems. Subsequently, by adding two additional terms in the weight s updating laws, a modified identification scheme is proposed to guarantee the effectiveness of the identification algorithm during the whole identification process. Lastly, through introducing some filtered variables, a robust neural network training algorithm is proposed for the system identification problem subjected to measurement noises. Based on the identification results, the singular perturbation theory is introduced to decompose a high order multi-time-scale system into two low order subsystems   the reduced slow subsystem and the reduced fast subsystem. Then, two controllers are designed for the two subsystems separately. By using the singular perturbation theory, an adaptive controller for a regulation problem is designed in this research firstly. Because the system order is reduced, the adaptive controller proposed in this research has a simpler structure and requires much less computational resources, compared with other conventional controllers. Afterwards, an indirect adaptive controller is proposed for solving the trajectory tracking problem. The stability of both identification and control schemes are analyzed through the Lyapunov approach, and the effectiveness of the identification and control algorithms are demonstrated using simulations and experiments.

This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract Most of the Researchers  interest is focusing on Bridge Management System (BMS), by its Maintenance, Repair & Rehabilitation (MR&R) segments, while a good practice of bridge management should cover the conceptual design phase of a new bridge. Although conceptual design is one stage of a bridge life whereas there is still limited knowledge on how it should be conducted. Most often engineers  decisions are based on their past experience and standard solutions, which are affected by the subjectivity. This approach, most probably, does not reflect the effective way to address different problems of consistency in the decision. To design a new bridge, many factors, like the cost and aesthetic behavior, have to be considered due to their ability to affect the final decision. Generally, decision-makers will make their final design and decisions based on those factors in addition to human subjectivity. The objective of this research is to propose a methodology to develop systematic procedures that can help decision-makers select the most appropriate bridge type with its diverse components and to forecast its Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) and other characteristics such as the public satisfaction and environment sustainability of the selected bridge type. The proposed methodology integrates a decision support system with a relevant database within an artificial intelligence environment (AI) and bridge information management tools in order to reduce the impact of human subjectivity on the decision taken during the conceptual design stage of bridges life. For this purpose, Machine Learning technique, which is a part of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) environment, will be the core of the proposed methodology. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with its back-propagation algorithm is adopted in order to identify the appropriate solution by setting up its engine guidelines. A polynomial regression method will first be integrated in the DSS: 1) to formulate the database in order to establish the needed functions; 2) to define the input values for the ANN; and 3) to verify the intermediate ANN weightiness of the proposed methodology engine based on historic data retrieved from the database. An investigation will be conducted in order to define bridge characteristics and parameters, to be used in the ANN, and that affect the final decision. Elements of the ANN layers (Engine model) which include: Input, Hidden & output layers, have to be described based on a systematic and standardized process. The proposed methodology has the potential to be used in lower levels to determine other bridge components such as vertical structures, foundations and connection types. The objectives of the proposed methodology can be summarized as follow: Avoiding, as much as possible, the influence of human subjectivity on the decision-making process. Listing and Ranking all the other possible alternatives. Ensuring equivalent and fair consideration for all factors affecting the decision, and especially reducing the possibility to miss and overlook the impact of some factors that could be ignored while proceeding with making the right decision by using conventional decision-making approaches. Developing a model that can be considered as a guideline for further use that can be applied within any decision-making environment and based on a relevant historic database and experts  input.

Abstract Following the June 22, 1940 armistice and the subsequent occupation of northern France by the Germans, the French government left Paris and eventually established itself in the city of Vichy. The name  Vichy  soon came to be used to refer to the regime instigated by P tain and his ministers. The shortcut was maintained and popularized in the postwar period, to the great displeasure of the Vichyssois, who have long been refusing to incorporate the war into the city s history. Whereas the Vichy regime is considered one of the most defining historical events of France s recent past, in the French memorial landscape of the Second World War, the city of Vichy continues to stand out as a non lieu de m moire. This dissertation investigates the wartime period in Vichy and explores how the population has dealt with the fraught legacy of the Vichy regime from 1944 to the present. My research examines how the interaction between national mythology, specific local concerns, and broader troubling issues have impacted   and often blocked   the formation of a local war memory. In the immediate postwar years, local resisters strove to establish a strong memory of the resistance. At the same time, a powerful victimhood myth emerged in response to the city s fears of stigmatization and ostracism. The spa tourism s recovery in the early 1950s marked a significant change in the city s memorial politics, leading to the memory of the war being pushed into the background, thereby establishing a tradition of silence in Vichy. This, however, does not mean that the memories of the war never resurfaced. They did, especially during the Algerian War. In the 1950s, Vichy s economy largely depended on colonial spa tourism. Known as the  Capitale d t  de l Afrique du Nord,  Vichy was indeed a privileged summer destination for thousands of settlers, especially pieds noirs from Algeria. The fear provoked by the prospect of a grave economic crisis in the event that Algeria would become independent led to a rightward shift of the population. This shift provided the ideal environment for a pro-P tain memory to gather strength in Vichy, beyond P tain s traditional extreme right base. While in the 1950s, P tain s myth also enjoyed a revival of popularity in France, it declined rapidly, when, following the end of the Algerian War, the extreme right hit historical lows. In Vichy, on the other hand, this counter memory continued to develop in the 1960s. In the post 1970s period, although the local Petainist memory went underground, no other memory has risen to occupy a central place in the local collective remembering of the war, turning the city into a non lieu de m moire and making it a counter example of what has been happening in many other places across Europe, where the most shameful aspects of the Second World War have been memorialized.

Abstract The main objective of this research was to develop an advanced system for industrial wastewater treatment which could produce an excellent quality effluent. The subsequent objectives were: i) to reduce the initial concentration of carbon, nutrients, and color-forming substances compared to conventional treatment systems, ii) to investigate removal mechanisms in the new system under electric field, iii) to optimize the system by studying the relationship between various operating parameters. To achieve these objectives an innovative compact electro-anaerobic membrane bioreactor (EAnMBR) was designed and its high performance was researched in two operational configurations. In the EAnMBR, physicochemical, biological and electrokinetic processes interacted simultaneously permitting to control the effluent quality and sludge properties. The dark-color molasses-based wastewater containing the high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (53,000 mgL-1), total nitrogen (2,300 mgL-1), total phosphorus (150 mgL-1), was selected for this research and submitted to multi-phase studies. The research allowed to define optimal operational conditions leading to removal of carbon, nutrients by 99% and to complete discoloration in the EAnMBR system. The novel system was compared with anaerobic membrane bioreactor showing performance superiority of EAnMBR in respect to COD, sludge volume reduction and filterability by 10%, 54% and 7%, respectively. A separate experimental phase was dedicated to optimize the energy balance in the novel system by the surface response method. The EAnMBR demonstrated outstanding results which make it a promising advanced wastewater treatment technology for various applications, e.g. in food, agriculture and defence industries.

Herein, we report the anionic polymerization of allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) on methoxy-PEG (mPEG) as macroinitiator to produce the diblock copolymer mPEG-b-PAGE. The mPEG-b-PAGE copolymer was then used as a common precursor to generate a systematic series of copolymers derivatized with pendant alkyl chains via thiolene click chemistry. These amphiphilic block copolymers were found to self-assemble in aqueous solution to form aggregates with distinct and unique morphologies. Depending on the hydrophobic weight fraction of the copolymer, spheres, long filomicelles, rods, disks and polymersomes with confirmed biocompatibility were formed. These materials were evaluated in terms of ability to solubilize the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). For each copolymer, stable micelle formulations were prepared that included high DOX to copolymer ratios of up to 20 % (wt%) with drug loading efficiencies > 60 % (w/w). In vitro drug release studies, conducted under physiologically relevant conditions, revealed sustained release profiles. Assessment of cytotoxicity in OVCAR8 human ovarian cancer cells grown in monolayers and spheroids confirmed that the activity of the formulated drug was conserved. The promising preliminary assessment of these alkylated copolymers encourages additional evaluation in vivo. Dr. Le D v dec carried out his undergraduate degree in biochemistry at UQAM. Under the supervision of Prof. M.A Mateescu, he completed his MSc in biochemistry in 2008 (with Honors).

Recently, multiple cooperative UAVs have been applied in various applications such as forest fire detection and fighting, search and exploration, environmental monitoring and surveillance. The main objectives of this dissertation are to design novel algorithms for single quadrotor UAV trajectory tracking control and multiple UAVs for cooperative/formation control. Then, applying these algorithms in forest monitoring and fire detection application, where a group of detection UAVs are required to surround and track the fire perimeter for monitoring and observation mission. Furthermore, new algorithm for fault-tolerant cooperative control (FTCC) is proposed, in order to mitigate potential UAVs fault effect for reliable and safe mission completion. Finally, a fire fighting algorithm is developed for achieving optimum distances for forest fire UAVs agents to arrive at their assigned fire spots destinations. A combination of sliding mode control (SMC) and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is used to design a single quadrotor UAV controller, which is then used to design a formation controller of multiple UAVs. Moreover, another formation controller is designed based on SMC to achieve robust formation control against modeling uncertainties and disturbances. Cooperative UAVs have been applied in forest monitoring and fire detection application through three stages: search, confirmation and observation. UAVs are assigned to search for potential forest fires in a certain area, once a fire is detected and a fire alarm will be generated. The UAVs team then reconfigures its formation by following a new elliptic fire perimeter, calculated by the ground station (GS) using a fire spread model. Afterwards, the confirmation stage begins and all UAVs start evenly distributed for surrounding the fire spot according to the UAVs number in the team. When the fire alarm is confirmed, the observation stage starts and UAVs continue tracking the fire along the fire perimeter. SMC is used to design a formation reconfigurable controller to switch between a predefined formation shape during the search stage, to a dynamic surrounding formation. This controller guarantees even distribution of UAVs surrounding the fire spots and the robustness against disturbances. In addition, task assignment is used with multiple fire spots and multiple UAVs teams in order to reduce the mission execution time. Moreover, the proposed control algorithms are implemented to a team of UAVs paired with a team of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), by using these UGVs as a take-off and landing platform in forest monitoring and fire detection application. Meanwhile, UAVs can need leave formation for refueling/recharging during the mission of search, confirmation and observation, or if a fault occurred during the mission due to fire flames, heat or UAV s internal fault sources. Therefore, an FTCC algorithm is designed based on the graph theory to mitigate the fault effect on mission completion, and ensure complete surrounding and data gathering of the fire spots using different fire sensors such as infrared cameras, charge-coupled devices (CCD) cameras and thermal cameras etc. Afterwards, data gathered during observation stage are implemented in the GS, then dangerous fire spots coordinates are sent to the fire fighting UAVs. The leader UAV, the GS, or both can perform the task assignment process using an auction-based or Hungarian algorithms, then each UAV is assigned a fire spot for deploying fire suppressant. Furthermore, a hybrid approach of control parametrization and time discretization (CPTD) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to achieve minimum flight distance for each UAV to arrive at its destination, minimizing fuel/battery consumption. Since PSO cannot solve the continuous control inputs, CPTD is used to provide an approximate piecewise linearization of the control inputs. Thus, PSO can be adopted to achieve the global optimum solution. Finally, the proposed algorithms are being implemented on single and multiple quadrotor UAVs in simulations. While, the leader-follower approach is used in cooperative control in a decentralized manner to avoid the disadvantages of centralization. Thereafter, the proposed algorithms are verified on a set of Qball-X4 quadrotor UAVs and QGV unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) platforms in real-time experiments through different scenarios.

Rebecca Reuber, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto and Eileen Fischer, Schulich School of Business, York University Every new firm must find a means of creating value. Increasing numbers of them are doing so by enrolling unpaid outside actors in value co-creation. This paper inductively develops new theory about the consequences for new firms of relying on such value co-creation from inception. Through an in-depth, qualitative, study of Twitter, we theorize that co-creation intensity (the extent to which diverse external actors are empowered to co engage in value co-creation) increases the likelihood that an emerging firm will experience scope expansion (a proliferation of value propositions and infrastructure requirements). Co-creation intensity, together with scope expansion, in turn precipitates stakeholder ambivalence, which entails both stakeholder uncertainty about the category to which the new firm belongs and mixed reactions to engagement with it. These theoretical insights extend the literatures on opportunity creation by new ventures, and on value co-creation. They also offer practical insights for new firms endeavouring to establish viable business models.

Meet Stuart Marshall (1949-1993). In 1984, British video artist Stuart Marshall debuted two new works that boldly reacted to the homophobic response of international media to the AIDS crisis: the video installation, Journal of the Plague Year at Galerie Optica, Montreal as part of Video '84; and the now iconic hybrid documentary Bright Eyes, for the 11th Hour on Channel 4, Marshall's first for British television. London-based artist and programmer Conal McStravick s lecture will contextualise Marshall s significant and influential works on HIV/AIDS by drawing on the works themselves, archival TV appearances and documentation. McStravick will illustrate how Marshall's voice and his polemical stance on the representation of HIV/AIDS and AIDS activism resonated with international audiences and helped to propel debates about the pandemic in new directions. By applying both experimental video and existing televisual forms and conventions, Marshall addressed feminism, queer politics and AIDS activism in turn. A method that would define an influential, intersectional cultural/ critical programme that continues to influence contemporary research and practice today.  Meet Stuart Marshall  is accompanied by a panoply of World AIDS Week activities devoted to reviving the artist s work: two screening programs of his most important short works, plus a restoration of Journal of the Plague Year in conversation with selected video works by Concordia sexuality and film students entitled Generations at the VAV Gallery. Conal McStravick (b.1979, Lurgan, N.Ireland) makes solo and collaborative works to explore the histories, social practices, and economies of art and queer politics. In 2013, McStravick began researching Marshall and has since developed a series of active research events titled Learning in a Public Medium. This series explores Marshall's works, legacies and contemporary resonances as artist, activist, writer and educator through workshops, screenings and presentations. McStravick has appeared on panels at Glasgow Film Theatre, BFI London and Birkbeck Institute of the Moving Image to talk about queer film and video, Marshall and the Learning in a Public Medium project.

A couple-level study. December 1, 2016, 1 p.m.   4 p.m. When studying for a doctoral degree (PhD), candidates submit a thesis that provides a critical review of the current state of knowledge of the thesis subject as well as the student s own contributions to the subject. The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract This qualitative study uses a grounded theory approach to examine work-family decision-making at the couple-level. It focuses on answering two questions: (1) How do couples develop and enact work-family routines and make non-routine decisions? And, (2) What is the role of identity construal in the way couples carry out their daily work-family responsibilities? By focusing on daily (or micro-role) experiences, I learned that daily work-family decisions are indeed made at the couple-level and that there are three types of daily work-family decisions, including decisions about work-family routines, decisions about immediate, unanticipated changes to routines and decisions about anticipated, scheduled events. Anchoring decisions made by couples over time create the context for decision-making for all three types of daily decisions. In terms of how couples make daily decisions at the work-family interface, I found that they consider multiple cues, including situational cues from their work and family contexts, activities cues, cues from their routines, cues from their relationships with one another, and cues related to family and parenting role expectations, but that the cues to which they attend and the processes for making sense of them varies by the type decision and the type of couple making the decision. Overall, my analysis of daily decisions revealed that these decisions are made in a manner consistent with a logic of appropriateness, which involves situational recognition and enactment of appropriate behavioral rules. These rules emanate from family role construals. Couples can be classified according to differences in their family role construals and each couple type uses different appropriateness rules, and thus tends to favour different choices for both anchoring and daily decisions. From a practical perspective, the results of this study have implications for couples looking for better strategies to meet their work and family responsibilities and for supervisors looking for better ways to support employees  efforts in carrying out their various roles. Theoretically, this research complements past work-family research, which has predominately focused on individual-level models and the negative aspects of combining personal roles with paid work. Also, it extends applications of identity theory in work-family science by broadening our understanding about the role of identity construals in work-family decisions.

English THE CROSSING tells the difficult story of individuals forced into displacement and takes us along on one of the most dangerous journeys of our time with a group of Syrians fleeing war and persecution, crossing a sea, two continents and five countries, searching for a home to rekindle the greatest thing they have lost - Hope. On a summer night, a group of Syrians wade quietly into the Mediterranean, with little children, a cat and little packets of food wrapped in cling-film held above their heads to climb into little boats that will take them to a fishing boat waiting in deeper waters. The little boat keels over from imbalanced loading. In the panic to save the children, they lose the cat and most of the food and water they have. A mother of 2 young children wants to return ashore, but it is too late, the police may have reached the beach and the only way available is into the sea. They are journalists, engineers, a musician and a psychologist climbing aboard an old unseaworthy fishing boat, manned by desperate smugglers who have never before sailed beyond coastal fishing waters. They make it to Europe, only to find out that the hardest part of their journey still lies ahead. Months of uncertainty and waiting, living in one centre after another, takes a toll on their spirits as they confront what being a  refugee  means. Where Room 110, Henry F.

November 25, 2016, 2:30 p.m.   3:30 p.m. Synthetic photochemistry has experienced a tremendous resurgence in interest. Photochemistry is viewed as a  green  strategy for organic synthesis, and new developments in photocatalysis employing visible light, as well as enabling technologies like continuous flow techniques, have all likely contributed to renewed interest in exploited photochemical activation as a tool in synthesis. The development of new Cu-based heteroleptic photocatalysts, their uses in synthesis and comparison with existing UV light-mediated reactions will be discussed. Shawn K. Collins was born in 1974 and raised in Val d'Or, Qu bec. He obtained a B.Sc. (Honours) degree from Concordia University in 1996 while working with Professor Ozzie S. Tee.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract Individuals differ in their chronotype, which ranges on a continuum from extreme morningness to extreme eveningness (Natale and Cicogna, 2002). Individuals exhibiting extreme morningness, also called larks, rise in the early hours of the morning and go to bed early at night, while those exhibiting extreme eveningness, also called owls, rise in the late hours of the morning and go to bed late at night (Horne and  sterberg, 1976, 1977). This thesis addresses a call from marketing scholars to better understand intra-day consumer behaviours and preferences, by investigating two time-related variables, chronotype and time-of-day, within the context of tourism. More specifically, it examines the influence of chronotype and time-of-day on travellers  behavioural intentions, overall satisfaction with a tourist destination and lifetime value for a tourist destination. It consists of two studies using a survey methodology. Study 1 focuses on 1982 consumers who travelled to the tourist destination under investigation at some point in the past, regardless of the year of their last trip. Study 2 focuses on 1483 consumers who travelled to the tourist destination under investigation within the past eight months. Results demonstrate that chronotype influences behavioural intentions and several indicators of customer lifetime value, and that time-of-day moderates the influence of chronotype on the likelihood of visiting the tourist destination.

Although we often think of political discourse as rational, literary sources are crucial to democratic politics as they can offer a civic education or way for citizens to think about and understand politics and political debates. Such literary sources are also essential to democratic discourse because they provide a way to engage in politics through critique and protest. Targeting experts from political science, English, comparative literature, classics, history, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, and the liberal arts, this workshop will identify crosscutting research areas which explore the important contribution of alternative epistemological approaches to understanding, promoting, and critiquing democratic practices. Within this theme, the one-day event will investigate the state of research on literary approaches to democratic political thought and identify key areas for future research. The long-term goal will result in an edited volume on the topic. Faculty and PhD Students should submit short abstracts of approximately 250 words.

EN For over three decades, the annual undergraduate exhibition has presented works by students in the Faculty of Fine Arts at Concordia University. In recent years, the initiative has expanded to include writers from the department of Art History and designers from the department of Design and Computation Arts. Together, a uniquely designed catalogue illustrates the diversity of works and texts that reveal the breadth of talent found within the faculty of fine arts. We are pleased to introduce a new layer to this year s iteration and are working with performers from Concordia s department of Contemporary Dance. As such, the growing collaboration has compelled us to come up with a theme to unify the participating disciplines. The thematic of  space  was introduced to encourage thought-provoking concepts that stem from notions of space, which has the potential to be interpreted broadly within various creative practices. For example, there is the space between generations, pictorial space, the space between performer and audience, geographic space, queer space, political space, outer space, to name only a few. The FOFA Gallery salutes the extraordinary work of the artists, writers, designers and dancers proving that cross-disciplinary practice continues to be an engaging approach within the creative process. We also wish to acknowledge the dedicated guidance from professors in all of these departments who have inspired a dynamic illustration of current interests and artistic explorations.

This fact highlights the importance of improving indoor air quality (IAQ) in in areas including sustainable buildings. Among different air pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) constitute a major part of indoor pollutants. The proven negative impact of these compounds in occupants  health has motivated researchers to develop different air treatment technologies for the removal of VOCs. Development of plasma-based methods, and their remarkable capabilities for VOCs degradation, has motivated designers to employ these methods as indoor air purification. It has been demonstrated that utilizing a dual functional adsorbent/catalyst (DFA/C) in a plasma system can significantly enhance the VOCs removal and energy efficiency of such an air purifier. However, selecting an appropriate DFA/C is a challenge to achieve the best performance in these systems. For the first time, this research attempted to utilize metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as DFA/Cs for a plasma-driven catalytic reactor. Accordingly, three different MOFs, MIL-101 (MIL: Metal institute Lavoisier), MIL-53, and CPM-5 (CPM: Crystalline Porous Material-5), were synthesized through microwave, solvothermal and mechanochemical methods. To test the performance of these DFA/Cs, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) system was designed and implemented as a non-thermal plasma (NTP) set-up. During preparation and evaluation experiments, different characterization and analytical instruments, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), BET surface area analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas Chromatogram/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS), Ozone monitor, and VOC Photoionization detector (PID), were utilized. Several adsorption and oxidation experiments were conducted to study physical and chemical behaviors of MOFs for the removal of one (1) ppm toluene and isobutanol on MIL-101, MIL-53 and CPM-5. Also, the effect of the presence of 30% relative humidity on the adsorption capacity and oxidation ability of each MOF was investigated. Results showed physisorption of VOCs on all MOFs during the course of adsorption tests. Moreover, the stable structure of the examined MOFs before and after plasma-catalytic reactions indicated a facile regeneration of catalysts. During the plasma-catalytic oxidation of toluene and isobutanol, different organic by-products and ozone were detected either in dry or humid conditions for all MOFs. MIL-101 and MIL-53 exhibited much higher adsorption and oxidation ability compared to CPM-5 in most of the experiments. Results demonstrated a higher adsorption capacity and almost the same oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 compared to MIL-53 in dry air. Nevertheless, the negative influence of humidity on adsorption and oxidation efficiency of MIL-101 was more significant than in MIL-53. In conclusion, results demonstrated the potential capacity of MOFs as DFA/Cs in a NTP system.

My research aims to explicate the positive (drinking to increase positive affect) and negative (drinking to reduce negative affect) reinforcement pathways that lead to problematic drinking, particularly for those transitioning from adolescence to early adulthood. Within this framework I examine the role of individual-level factors such as personality (i.e., motivational drive), anxiety, impulsivity, and alcohol-related cognitions (e.g., attitudes, associations, cognitive processes) to distinguish who is at risk and the processes of risk. In one line of my current work I am examining the interactive effects of behavioural inhibition/disinhibition and state affect on cue elicited alcohol associations, impulsivity, and subsequent alcohol use. Planned work in my lab includes: (a) refining measurement of alcohol-related cognition, such as assessments of implicit attitudes; (b) isolating social anxiety - and the intervening mechanisms - as a risk factor for negative reinforcement (self-medication) drinking in University students widely, and for women specifically; (c) integrating environmental-level factors (e.g., context)  into models of risk.

In 1994, after 18 months in a postdoctoral research position in Dr. Robert Sutherland's laboratory at the University of New Mexico, Dr. Mumby joined the Department of Psychology at Concordia University. In 1999 he joined the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology. Fun fact I have chickens at home, and I'm thinking of ways to formally test their memory abilities. Seriously. Research Object recognition, spatial memory, fear learning, context memory, neural systems Overview: My interests broadly include animal cognition, and the analysis and development of methods and procedures for assessing various types of memory in rodents. For example, some of our recent studies revealed concerns about the internal validity of a widely-used novel-object preference test of object-recognition memory. We are now developing a new and improved object-recognition task. We also study spatial memory, fear learning, memory for contextual information, and the modulation of memory by contextual cues. We employ an array of behavioral paradigms to assess different aspects of memory, including water-maze, t-maze, radial-arm maze, and open-field tests of spatial memory, novel-object preference and delayed nonmatching-to-sample tests of object recognition, shock-probe fear learning, predator avoidance, and social transmission of food preferences. Additional interests include the anatomy of memory systems underlying object-recognition and spatial memory. We occasionally conduct studies to assess these abilities in rats with surgical lesions of specific brain areas. Past studies have focused mainly on hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, amygdala, intralaminar and midline thalamus. To develop their reputations as independent researchers, my graduate students are encouraged to pursue lines of inquiry they can call their own. The main requirements for a suitable research plan are: 1) the questions must be timely and important to behavioural neuroscientists, 2) we must have the financial and physical resources to conduct the research, and 3) we must have expertise with the required behavioural tests. Recent Ph.D. students did dissertation research on a rat model of schizophrenia, and the modulatory effects of estrogen on object-recognition memory.

As part of my line of research, I am examining the pathogenesis of subclinical disease markers (cardiovascular reactivity, metabolic functioning, cardiac structural changes) across childhood and adolescence as mediated by potential behavioral (diet, exercise, lifestyle factors), environmental (stress exposure, social support, contextual effects), and psychological (coping style, cognitions, mood) mechanisms that influence these markers and possible confer susceptibility to developing cardiovascular disease.

My research program is based on the theory          that psychological stress is a risk factor only in those individuals who          are in some manner psychologically and/or biologically susceptible, and          that the etiology of cardiovascular disease is multifactorial in nature.          My approach has therefore been to examine alone and in interaction the          moderating influences of emotion, race, gender and family history on the          cardiovascular response to psychological stress. For example, we are currently          involved in two areas of research involving individual difference factors          in the risk for cardiovascular disease. One research stream involves the          study of hostile individuals who are at elevated risk for heart disease.          We are currently examining their cardiovascular responses to interpersonal          stress, and the potential role of serotonin in moderating the hostility-cardiovascular          relationship. A second stream involves the study of cardiovascular and          ambulatory blood pressure responses to laboratory and daily life stress          in Canadian Black men and women who are at elevated risk for hypertension          (high blood pressure).

It deals with psychosocial risk factors in childhood which increase the likelihood of disordered behavior and maladaptive lifestyles in adulthood. Our Concordia Longitudinal Risk Research Program which began in 1976 has been following inner-city aggressive and withdrawn French-speaking children into adulthood. The aim is to determine the factors that differentiate the developmental trajectories of at-risk children who do well from those who fare badly. The children are now in their thirties; so my current interest is in how they are doing in such domains as mental and physical health, employment, competence, affiliative ties, and parenting. I have a particular interest in gender role socialization, life stresses, social support, and coping efficacy as influences on outcomes in these domains of adult functioning. Studies in the risk research program currently deal with stress; intergenerational continuities of risk factors; and childhood predictors of adult adjustment.

Subsequently I attended the   University                                  of Waterloo and completed my   Ph.D. in Developmental                                  Psychology in   1986. I have been a member of the                                    Education Department, Concordia, ever since. In                                    1998 I was a visiting scholar at Lancaster University,                                    England.

Furthermore,                                      I am interested in how siblings co-construct                                      meaning in their relationship through play,                                      caretaking, teaching and use of   internal state                                    language (i.e.,   references to emotional, mental                                      states). Recently my work has focussed on young                                      children's social knowledge and understanding                                      of the sibling relationship, particularly within                                      the pretend play context. Currently I am   examining                                    the relations between   children pretense negotiations                                    and   conflict resolution, as well as the development                                      of intersubjectivity in sibling play and associations                                      with the quality of the relationship.   Another                                    project is investigating the   associations between                                    disclosure,   intimacy, and the quality of children                                      peer relationships in middle childhood. My current                                      SSHRC-funded project is to examine sibling teaching                                      from a social-constructivist framework. Influence of the design of dramatic play                                      centers on children's play: How the ecology of the early childhood classroom,                                      specifically dramatic play centers, affects                                      children's social and cognitive play.   This project                                    has both a theoretical   and applied focus. Based                                    on theory   regarding the importance of pretend                                      play in young children's development, I have                                      conducted a series of studies to determine how                                      to facilitate opportunities for dramatic play                                      in the early childhood classroom. Several of                                      my MA students have investigated   other aspects                                    of play, such as the   relationship between solitary                                    play   and children thinking styles or the influence                                      of different kinds of play materials (e.g.,                                      superhero or scripted toys) on children. Child care: Specifically recent                                      child care research and implications for Canadian                                      public policy. The majority of recent research                                      on child care emanates from the United   States,                                    however the Canadian context   differs from the                                    American in   significant economic and philosophical                                      ways. My work (with E. Jacobs) has pointed to                                      the importance of considering these differences                                      for the development of child care policy.   Professor                                    Jacobs and I are currently   engaged in a pan-Canadian                                    study of   curriculum in child care settings funded                                      through Human Resources Development Canada.                                      Specifically we are looking at provincial regulations                                      and guidelines for curriculum in child care                                      settings and how curriculum is taught   to future                                    educators enrolled in   community colleges. We                                    will also   conduct an inservice intervention                                      program focused on constructivist curriculum                                      for child care workers in three provinces (Manitoba,                                      Nova Scotia, Quebec). Finally, I have co-edited                                      a book (with L. Prochner) titled   Early Childhood                                    Care and Education in   Canada, which includes                                    historical   developments, current trends, and                                      future directions in Canadian early childhood                                      education.

Using neurophysiological techniques, students and myself aim to identify how the activity in the brain is coordinated, either in the basic rhythmicity or in a functional manner. We use recordings from many electrodes to describe brain waves and nerve cell activity. In the cerebellum specifically, it is not yet known how groups of cells interact to produce coordinated sensation and behavior. Techniques used in the lab focus on describing the underlying mechanisms shaping populations of neurons, using signals from many single units as well as field potentials in vivo in the awake or anesthetized animal. I study the neurophysiology of neuronal oscillations, centering on the cerebellum and basal ganglia.

Their work is multi-media and often involves easily found and/or scavenged materials. They are interested in getting lost while realizing the rarity of such a thing. So they make work to get lost in. Poorter and Akrey have been collecting stories and images from people who have a dead dad. They use these snippets of other people s memories, as fuel to create a morphing landscape installation.

My current work focuses on three major research questions:  a) What are the neuro-computationalmechanisms underlying learning in uncertain, dynamically changing environments and how do these learning processes develop across the human lifespan?  b) How does the ability to arbitrate between different learning strategies change as a function of age?  c) How do humans learn from the behavior of other individuals and how does this ability change during lifespan development?  Toaddress these questions I use a multi-methodological approach that combines experimental paradigms, computational modeling and neuroimaging (EEG, fMRI). Selected Publications Nassar, M.

You may select either the Major, Honours or Specialization . You can opt for the Bachelor of Arts (BA) or the Bachelor of Science (BSc) , which requires electives in the science. Are you a student registered in another department? You can add a minor in Psychology to complement your degree. What's more, Psychology BSc students may complete a Specialization or Honours in  Behavioural Neuroscience .  BA or BSc? What is the difference between a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and a Bachelor of Science (BSc)? Most students will have to complete 90 credits to earn a Bachelor's degree at Concordia. Most courses are worth three or six credits. Therefore, to complete a Bachelor's degree one would have to complete the equivalent of 30, three credit courses. If you are a student majoring in Psychology, many of your courses will be in Psychology and others (electives) will be taken in other departments (for example, Math, English, Sociology etc.). The number of Psychology credits that you have to take depends on whether you are in the Major, Specialization or Honours stream. In terms of your Psychology courses, there is no difference between the BA degree and the BSc. The difference comes in the electives. Science students will select a number of their electives from the sciences (Biology, Chemistry, and Physics) while Arts student will select primarily from the arts and humanities. A science background is required for students contemplating careers in neuroscience and it may be an asset in applying for medical school. Major, Specialization, or Honours What is the difference between Major, Specialization, and Honours? If you are a student majoring in Psychology, many of your courses will be in Psychology and others (electives) will be taken in other departments (for example, Math, English, Sociology etc.). The number of Psychology credits that you have to take depends on whether you are in the Major, Specialization or Honours stream. The minor is available to students majoring in a subject other than Psychology. The Major consists of 42 credits in Psychology and is relevant for someone seeking a good general degree which could have applications in a variety of fields related to teaching, business, personnel, or community involvement. The Specialization consists of 60 credits in Psychology and as a more concentrated program is appropriate for someone with career plans in an area involving Psychology. It can prepare students for employment in such areas as those listed above for the Major but is recognized as a more intensive degree. Depending on the selection of courses the Specialization may also provide a background for graduate work such as a Master s degree in counselling Psychology, or social work, or even in an MBA program. The Honours degree is the most intensive of all consisting of 66 credits of Psychology and including two Honours seminars and an Honours thesis in the last year. At least partly because of these courses this program gives the best preparation for admission to graduate school. Admission to Honours is by application and normally occurs after a student s first 30 credits have been completed with a GPA of 3.5. Students may apply to the Honours program directly from CEGEP if they have a CRC of at least 28. ", "title": "Program options"},

Abstract This thesis collects three articles that explore the construct of reflected appraisal  individuals  beliefs about how they are seen in the eyes of others. These manuscripts are linked by the overarching question  How do employees manage the bombardment of myriad reflected appraisals in their daily organizational lives?  To address this, the articles examine four workplace manifestations of reflected that are represented by the constructs of perceived supervisor support, organizational support, respect and external prestige (also called image) while considering the referents inherent in each construct (i.e., Co-workers, team members, the employing organization and external stakeholders). The theoretical manuscript (article 1) examines the four reflected appraisals together, asking what contextual and individual factors predict which reflected appraisals employees are more likely to focus on and when. We use employees  work-roles as the key construct that links these factors together, arguing that self-motives drive individuals to focus on some reflected appraisals under the constraint of accountability and interdependence that are part of the organizational structure. The quantitative manuscript (article 2) examines the concurrent impact of respect and prestige on relational and organizational identification. In a survey of student-athletes from varsity sports teams, we found that the matching principle prevailed: Prestige and respect that are focused on the relationship predicted relational identification while respect and prestige focused on the collective predicted organizational identification. However, prestige was the better predictor of both the relational and organizational foci. The qualitative manuscript (article 3) focuses on organizational image and explores how individuals respond to perceived organizational stigma. I interviewed employees of general contractors during a city-wide scandal in which various audiences marked their organizations as  the enemy  by virtue of their category-membership. I found that interviewees negotiated two images that embodied individuating and de-individuating reflected appraisals of their organization. Furthermore, employees constructed these images using various sources of information that they integrated into their reflected appraisals. Overall, the three articles demonstrate that employees actively engage with a plethora of reflected appraisals from multiple referents in the organizational environment.

Re-search-for-design is defined as a research activity performed by the designer in order to inform the design process. This study aims to better understand the contribution of research-for-design education, not only as a required activity in the design process, but also as a strategy to develop a vision for sustainable design. This comparative study examined two university design programs, the Concordia University in Montreal, Canada and the Universidad Aut noma de San Luis Potos  in San Luis Potos , Mexico. I examined student and teacher accounts of how research is taught in each program. Through a process of comparative analysis, I identified differences in the participating students and educators  backgrounds and design streams which led to varied perspectives of disciplinary practice. Formal and informal methods of doing research-for-design were identified and linked to accounts of teaching and learning. These practices in the education of research-for-design included intuitive, informal, spontaneous, ludic, innovative, visual, creative, social, and emphatic strategies. Teaching research-for-design demands an effective way to connect students with their entire environment. By doing this, the education of research-for-design will empower students  understanding of the design process with the potential to promote ethical, sustainable, comprehensive, and integrative design.

Abstract: What is schizophrenia? Schizophrenia manifests differently in different cultures, according to different modes of understanding. Modern scientific understandings of the disease categorize it as a neurological disorder, primarily biological or genetic in nature, with the experience of the disease manifesting in the  split mind(s)  (schizo- phr ne) of patients. But there is mounting empirical evidence to suggest that biogenetic and neurologically reductive approaches are limited with respect to their treatment outcomes, and   as I argue   specifically alienating to patients. Patients are faced both with social alienation, and a sense of alienation from self   I argue that this is primarily by the disease s interaction with its cultural and political situatedness, rather than by the manifestation of disease itself. Leaning on Marx and Foucault, I seek to readdress the question of schizophrenic ontology in this essay, motivating for a model that will attenuate the experience of alienation thought symptomatic of schizophrenia by approaching it as dialectical co-production of both biogenetic, and sociocultural factors. The result is to argue for the irreducibility of the experience of vulnerability in future research seeking to open up treatment options for patients with schizophrenia.

Abstract This dissertation analyzes the convoluted process by which Irish nationalists, Irish unionists, and British politicians negotiated Irish self-government in the first two decades of the twentieth century. In December 1909, a modest form of self-government known as home rule within the British Empire for all of Ireland became a practical issue in United Kingdom politics again, after the failure of two previous home rule bills in 1886 and 1893. After a decade that witnessed a world war and a revolution in Ireland, two new Irish polities emerged by June 1922. Northern Ireland, a majority-unionist state comprised of six counties in the province of Ulster, acquired a limited form of home rule within the United Kingdom. Covering the rest of the island, the Irish Free State secured significant control of its domestic affairs as a dominion of the British Empire, though not the complete independence demanded by Sinn F in and the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which had waged the revolution. How did the main political parties and actors in Britain and Ireland arrive at this settlement, especially as it was so different from how elites had envisioned Irish self-government in 1909? Using archival material and public discourse, this dissertation seeks to answer this question by methodically analyzing the political decisions taken by British and Irish political parties and movements between 1909 and 1922. It challenges historical conceptions that the settlement enacted by the Government of Ireland Act (1920) and the Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921) was an inevitable evolution in Anglo-Irish relations, that it marks the British government s recognition of the Irish right to self-determination, or the triumph of Irish democracy. Instead, I argue that the settlement was highly contingent upon prevailing political circumstances, heavily influenced by British interests, and often defied the democratic demands of Irish people, both nationalist and unionist. Partition, the separation of Ireland into two different states, was achieved through the acquiescence of British politicians to the demands of Ulster unionist leaders, without reference to public opinion in any part of Ireland.

Kristin is on the board of directors of the  Borneo Orangutan Society Canada , and the author of two books on the philosophy of animal minds. Abstract: Traditionally, discussions of moral participation   and in particular moral agency   have focused on fully formed human actors. There has been some interest in the development of morality in humans, as well as interest in cultural differences when it comes to moral practices, commitments, and actions. However, until relatively recently there has been little focus on the possibility that nonhuman animals have any role to play in morality, save being the object of moral concern. Moreover, when nonhuman cases are considered as evidence of moral agency or subjecthood, there has been a tendency to focus on higher-order moral behaviors (i.e., those same behaviors that inform our views about human moral agency). If we are to understand the evolution of moral psychology and moral practice, then this relative lack of attention to the practices of other animals and this persistent focus on the moral instead of the normative have been great oversights. A biologically responsible way of examining the distribution of moral practice in other animals starts from considering the distribution of normative practice across species. Drawing on the work of psychologists and anthropologists, the normative foundations of morality across humans demonstrates that some animals chimpanzees and cetaceans in particular demonstrate many of the moral foundations that indicate the existence of a cognitive modality I call na ve normativity.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract This thesis contributes and provides solutions to the problem of fault diagnosis and estimation from three different perspectives which are i) fault diagnosis of nonlinear systems using nonlinear multiple model approach, ii) inversion-based fault estimation in linear systems, and iii) data-driven fault diagnosis and estimation in linear systems. The above contributions have been demonstrated to the gas turbines as one of the most important engineering systems in the power and aerospace industries. The proposed multiple model approach is essentially a hierarchy of nonlinear Kalman filters utilized as detection filters. A nonlinear mathematical model for a gas turbines is developed and verified. The fault vector is defined using the Gas Path Analysis approach. The nonlinear Kalman filters that correspond to the defined single or concurrent fault modes provide the conditional probabilities associated with each fault mode using the Bayes  law. The current fault mode is then determined based on the maximum probability criteria. The performance of both Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF) are investigated and compared which demonstrates that the UKF outperforms the EKF for this particular application. The problem of fault estimation is increasingly receiving more attention due to its practical importance. Fault estimation is closely related to the problem of linear systems inversion. This thesis includes two contributions for the stable inversion of non-minimum phase systems. First, a novel methodology is proposed for direct estimation of unknown inputs by using only measurements of either minimum or non-minimum phase systems as well as systems with transmission zeros on the unit circle. A dynamic filter is then identified whose poles coincide with the transmission zeros of the system. A feedback is then introduced to stabilize the above filter dynamics as well as provide an unbiased estimation of the unknown input. The methodology is then applied to the problem of fault estimation and has been shown that the proposed inversion filter is unbiased for certain categories of faults. Second, a solution for unbiased reconstruction of general inputs is proposed. It is based on designing an unknown input observer (UIO) that provides unbiased estimation of the minimum phase states of the system. The reconstructed minimum phase states serve then as inputs for reconstruction of the non-minimum phase states. The reconstruction error for non-minimum phase states exponentially decrease as the estimation delay is increased. Therefore, an almost perfect reconstruction can be achieved by selecting the delay to be sufficiently large. The proposed inversion scheme is then applied to the output-tracking control problem. An important practical challenge is the fact that engineers rarely have a detailed and accurate mathematical model of complex engineering systems such as gas turbines. Consequently, one can find a trend towards data-driven approaches in many disciplines, including fault diagnosis. In this thesis, explicit state-space based fault detection, isolation and estimation filters are proposed that are directly identified from only the system input-output (I/O) measurements and through the system Markov parameters. The proposed procedures do not involve a reduction step and do not require identification of the system extended observability matrix or its left null space. Therefore, the performance of the proposed filters is directly connected to and linearly dependent on the errors in the Markov parameters estimation process. The estimation error dynamics is then derived in terms of the Markov parameters identification errors and directly synthesized from the healthy system I/O data. Consequently, the estimation errors have been effectively compensated for. The proposed data-driven scheme requires the persistently exciting condition for healthy input data which is not practical for certain real life applications and in particular to gas turbine engines. To address this issue, a robust methodology for Markov parameters estimation using frequency response data is developed. Finally, the performance of the proposed data-driven approach is comprehensively evaluated for the fault diagnosis and estimation problems in the gas turbine engines.

The malleability of memory, hypnosis and hypnotizability, and the scientificity of some clinical concepts linked to memory and consciousness. Distortions and creations of memories are particularly relevant to our understanding of day to day memory, experience and self-consciousness. This research has important implications in the legal (eye-witness testimonies, autobiographical memories, expert testimony), and clinical (causal attributions of current symptoms) contexts. We seek to better understand the factors at play when an individual attempts to remember real life events. Individual factors, like suggestibility and hypnotizability, social-psychological factors (beliefs, expectations) and cognitive factors like one s attentional and perceptual networks are some of the factors that we believe important in understanding the construction of memories. A second area of research investigates the different aspects of hypnotizability and hypnosis. What makes an individual hypnotizable? Why do individuals respond differently to a hypnotic induction? What is the role of volition in hypnotic and non-hypnotic responses? How can hypnotic behaviours and experiences inform us on conscious and non-conscious processes? A final area of interest is the theoretical evaluation of the scientificity of psychological concepts that are commonly used in lay and professional contexts.  Examples of these are consciousness and non-consciousness, volition, intuition, repression, dissociation, body memories, etc. The common thread relating these three areas is the evaluation of the role of non-conscious processes, proximal (attentional processing) and distal (beliefs), in the elicitation of overt behaviours and experiences.

Key areas of interest include the study of stressful life events, hormones (i.e. hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stress response), oxytocin (a peptide important in social behaviour), and cognitive-emotional mechanisms of self-regulation. Current projects include an ongoing longitudinal high-risk study of the offspring of parents with bipolar disorder, studies focusing on emotional information processing and its relationship to depression and poor interpersonal functioning, and laboratory-based studies of stress and psychophysiology.

[PubMed] [Content] Research Drug and Alcohol Abuse, Relapse, Neuropharmacology, Pavlovian conditioning, Optogenetics Overview: Fundamental learning processes like Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning play a central role in the use, misuse and abuse of psychoactive substances like alcohol. In my laboratory, we use preclinical models in rats to study psychological processes and neurobiological systems that regulate drug-seeking behaviours and relapse. Neuroscientific techniques include neuropharmacology, in-vivo optogenetics, chemogenetics, in-vitro electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We are currently pursing three exciting research directions that probe the central hypothesis that environmental stimuli that become associated with alcohol help to maintain alcohol use and trigger relapse. Project 1 seeks to identify neural processes that are needed for the expression of alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Project 2 investigates brain mechanisms that mediate the inhibition or extinction of responding to Pavlovian cues that occurs when a cue is no longer followed by an expected event. Project 3 examines the effect of nicotine, the main active ingredient in tobacco, on alcohol-seeking behaviours triggered by Pavlovian alcohol cues. Translational studies are also underway to test the utility of compounds that act on the cholinergic system in the brain in preventing relapse to alcohol seeking behaviour. Through this research, we hope to expand our understanding of how drug abuse develops and inform new treatments for dependence and addiction.

My projects are aimed at identifying and measuring the fundamental characteristics of children's interactions and relationships with their peers and determining how these experiences affect behavioral development, emotional adjustment and physical health.   The four current themes of my research projects are (a) contextual/cultural variation in the peer experiences and the processes that account for variations in their effects, (b)  the intersection between peer experiences and psychophysiology especially the response to stress, (c) gene/environment interactions  and gene environment correlations and the long term consequences of peer experiences, and (d) gender differences especially as they are related to culture.

A new memory requires the formation of a memory trace, or \"engram\", in the brain. First, the hippocampus and other nearby cortical areas are thought to integrate sensory inputs into a cohesive representation. Then, memory is stored more permanently through connections with other parts of the brain including the neocortex. A major mechanism through which circuits of the brain can learn is through long-lasting increases (or decreases) in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. My lab examines how changes in synaptic strength occur in parahippocampal and neocortical regions of the rat. Electrophysiological recording techniques are used to monitor synaptic strength and to examine how neuromodulatory systems (cholingergic, dopaminergic) and rhythmic EEG activities control changes in how neurons interact with one another. Both graduate and undergraduate students make important contributions to this research. Please contact me if you are interested in conducting an Honours thesis, Specialization project, or Science College project in the lab.

By participating in research, these students have the opportunity to gain a better appreciation of psychological testing and experimentation. However, as there are potential risks associated with classroom recruitment and student testing, these guidelines are intended to facilitate the collection of participants and/or data in undergraduate classroom settings at Concordia University, while protecting the rights of student research participants. Approaching the Instructor The instructor should be provided with the following information well in advance of the classroom visit: Who is supervising the project. When the recruiter would prefer to visit the class. How long the class visit will take. The nature of the recruitment (sign up sheet, screening questionnaire, etc.) What (if any) testing will occur at the time of recruitment. Recruiting in Class When the recruiter visits the classroom, the following information should be provided to the students: The name of the recruiter(s) and the faculty member(s) supervising the project. Contact information for the lab(s) in which the study is being conducted. What the study is meant to investigate. The nature of the study (questionnaire based, interview based, brief description of experimental tasks, etc.). The amount of time required to participate in the study. What compensation (if any) participants will receive for their time. When the study is being conducted (Are appointments set?, Can students drop by the lab?, etc.). Student should be informed that the data that they may provide during the course of their participation are completely unrelated to their required coursework or grade. That participation is completely voluntary and that participants can refuse or withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences whatsoever. The nature and/or limits of confidentiality in the study. Ideally, the recruiter should leave the room while sign up sheets and/or questionnaires are being completed so that students will be free to either participate or decline to participate. Testing in Class Due to the possible demands produced by testing in groups, in the presence of experimenters and/or in the presence of course instructors, testing in classrooms is discouraged. If in-class testing is deemed to be essential, the following measures (in addition to the above 10 points) should be taken to protect students from coercion and to ensure the confidentiality of their participation: Participants should be told that their results will not be made available to their instructor. Participants who choose not to participate should not be separated or otherwise identified during classroom testing. (This may be accomplished by distributing packages to all students in the class and then stating that students are free to either spoil the materials or leave them blank before returning them.) In addition to written debriefing (see below), students should receive a brief oral debriefing in class about the purpose of the study. Debriefing All experimental and study participants have the right to be debriefed from psychological studies. In order to facilitate both a greater understanding of research in psychology and to provide other sources of related information about the study, student participants should receive a brief written debriefing sheet (less than one half page) upon completion of the study. The debriefing sheet should contain the following information: The name of the study, the experimenter(s) and the faculty supervisor(s). The telephone and other contact information for the lab(s) in which the study was conducted as well as contact information for the University Human Research Ethics Committee and the Psychology Department Ethics Committee. *The nature of the study (hypotheses, goals, etc.). *Some information about the design of the study (groups, measures, etc.). A brief statement about the importance or implications of the study. Citation of one or two suggested articles or book chapters for further reading. *If the study involves deception, it is acceptable for items 3 and 4 to be somewhat vague when distributed in written form, provided that a full oral debriefing is given to each participant. Ideally, this sheet will be accompanied by a brief oral debriefing period in which the above are explained to the student participant.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract An effective fault detection and isolation (FDI) technology can play a crucial role in improving the system availability, safety and reliability as well as reducing the risks of catastrophic failures. In this thesis, the robust sensor FDI problem of gas turbine engines is investigated and different novel techniques are developed to address the effects of parameter uncertainties, disturbances as well as process and measurement noise on the performance of FDI strategies. The efficiencies of proposed techniques are investigated through extensive simulation studies for the single spool gas turbine engine that is previously developed and validated using the GSP software. The gas turbine engine health degradation is considered in various forms in this thesis. First, it is considered as a part of the engine dynamics that is estimated off-line and updated periodically for the on-board engine model. Second, it is modeled as the time-varying norm-bounded parameter uncertainty that affects all the system state-space matrices and third as an unknown nonlinear dynamic that is approximated by the use of a dynamic recurrent neural network. In the first part of the thesis, we propose a hybrid Kalman filter (HKF) scheme that consists of a single nonlinear on-board engine model (OBEM) augmented with piecewise linear (PWL) models constituting as the multiple model (MM) based estimators to cover the entire engine operating regime. We have integrated the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)-based method with our MM-based scheme to estimate the sensor fault severity under various single and concurrent fault scenarios. In order to ensure the reliability of our proposed HKF-based FDI scheme during the engine life cycle, it is assumed that the reference baselines are periodically updated for the OBEM health parameters. In the second part of the thesis, a novel robust sensor FDI strategy using the MM-based approach is proposed that remains robust with respect to both time-varying parameter uncertainties and process and measurement noise. The scheme is composed of robust Kalman filters (RKF) that are constructed for mul- tiple PWL models. The parameter uncertainty is modeled by using a time-varying norm bounded admissible structure that affects all the PWL state space matrices. The robust Kalman filter gain matrices are designed by solving two algebraic Riccati equations (ARE) that are expressed as two linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibil- ity conditions. The main objective is to propose a robust filter that satisfies the overall performance requirements and is not affected by system perturbations. The requirements include a quadratically stable filter that ensures bounded estimation error variances having predefined values. In the third part of the thesis, a novel hybrid approach is proposed to improve the robustness of FDI scheme with respect to different sources of uncertainties. For this purpose, a dynamic recurrent neural network (DRNN) is designed to ap- proximate the gas turbine engine uncertainty due to the health degradations. The proposed DRNN is trained offline by using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) al- gorithm for an engine with different levels of uncertainty, but with healthy sensors. The convergence of EKF-based DRNN training algorithm is also investigated. Then, the trained DRNN with the fixed parameters and topology is integrated with our online model-based FDI algorithm to approximate the uncertainty terms of the real engine. In this part, the previously proposed HKF and RKF are integrated with the trained DRNN to construct the hybrid FDI structure.

We use well-established behavioral procedures (place conditioning, intracranial self-stimulation) in combination with neurochemical (in vivo microdialysis), neuroanatomical (immunohistochemistry) and molecular techniques (western immunoblotting) to investigate the effects of stimulant drugs on brain and behavior. We focus: 1) on how factors such as physical activity, circadian signals, and affective and learning processes alter the effects of stimulant drugs, and 2) on the long-lasting consequences of exposing the developing brain to stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate.

This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract Many industrial systems are nonlinear with  slow  and  fast  dynamics because of the presence of some  parasitic  parameters. These systems are usually labeled as  singularly perturbed  or  multi-time-scale  systems. Singular perturbation theory has been proved to be a useful tool to control and analyze singularly perturbed systems if the full knowledge of the system model parameters is available. However, the accurate and faithful mathematical models of those systems are usually difficult to obtain due to the uncertainties and nonlinearities. To obtain the accurate system models, in this research, a new identification scheme for the discrete time nonlinear singularly perturbed systems using multi-time-scale neural network and optimal bounded ellipsoid method is proposed firstly. Compared with other gradient descent based identification schemes, the new identification method proposed in this research can achieve faster convergence and higher accuracy due to the adaptively adjusted learning gain. Later, the optimal bounded ellipsoid based identification method for discrete time systems is extended to the identification of continuous singularly perturbed systems. Subsequently, by adding two additional terms in the weight s updating laws, a modified identification scheme is proposed to guarantee the effectiveness of the identification algorithm during the whole identification process. Lastly, through introducing some filtered variables, a robust neural network training algorithm is proposed for the system identification problem subjected to measurement noises. Based on the identification results, the singular perturbation theory is introduced to decompose a high order multi-time-scale system into two low order subsystems   the reduced slow subsystem and the reduced fast subsystem. Then, two controllers are designed for the two subsystems separately. By using the singular perturbation theory, an adaptive controller for a regulation problem is designed in this research firstly. Because the system order is reduced, the adaptive controller proposed in this research has a simpler structure and requires much less computational resources, compared with other conventional controllers. Afterwards, an indirect adaptive controller is proposed for solving the trajectory tracking problem. The stability of both identification and control schemes are analyzed through the Lyapunov approach, and the effectiveness of the identification and control algorithms are demonstrated using simulations and experiments.

Abstract Following the June 22, 1940 armistice and the subsequent occupation of northern France by the Germans, the French government left Paris and eventually established itself in the city of Vichy. The name  Vichy  soon came to be used to refer to the regime instigated by P tain and his ministers. The shortcut was maintained and popularized in the postwar period, to the great displeasure of the Vichyssois, who have long been refusing to incorporate the war into the city s history. Whereas the Vichy regime is considered one of the most defining historical events of France s recent past, in the French memorial landscape of the Second World War, the city of Vichy continues to stand out as a non lieu de m moire. This dissertation investigates the wartime period in Vichy and explores how the population has dealt with the fraught legacy of the Vichy regime from 1944 to the present. My research examines how the interaction between national mythology, specific local concerns, and broader troubling issues have impacted   and often blocked   the formation of a local war memory. In the immediate postwar years, local resisters strove to establish a strong memory of the resistance. At the same time, a powerful victimhood myth emerged in response to the city s fears of stigmatization and ostracism. The spa tourism s recovery in the early 1950s marked a significant change in the city s memorial politics, leading to the memory of the war being pushed into the background, thereby establishing a tradition of silence in Vichy. This, however, does not mean that the memories of the war never resurfaced. They did, especially during the Algerian War. In the 1950s, Vichy s economy largely depended on colonial spa tourism. Known as the  Capitale d t  de l Afrique du Nord,  Vichy was indeed a privileged summer destination for thousands of settlers, especially pieds noirs from Algeria. The fear provoked by the prospect of a grave economic crisis in the event that Algeria would become independent led to a rightward shift of the population. This shift provided the ideal environment for a pro-P tain memory to gather strength in Vichy, beyond P tain s traditional extreme right base. While in the 1950s, P tain s myth also enjoyed a revival of popularity in France, it declined rapidly, when, following the end of the Algerian War, the extreme right hit historical lows. In Vichy, on the other hand, this counter memory continued to develop in the 1960s. In the post 1970s period, although the local Petainist memory went underground, no other memory has risen to occupy a central place in the local collective remembering of the war, turning the city into a non lieu de m moire and making it a counter example of what has been happening in many other places across Europe, where the most shameful aspects of the Second World War have been memorialized.

Abstract The main objective of this research was to develop an advanced system for industrial wastewater treatment which could produce an excellent quality effluent. The subsequent objectives were: i) to reduce the initial concentration of carbon, nutrients, and color-forming substances compared to conventional treatment systems, ii) to investigate removal mechanisms in the new system under electric field, iii) to optimize the system by studying the relationship between various operating parameters. To achieve these objectives an innovative compact electro-anaerobic membrane bioreactor (EAnMBR) was designed and its high performance was researched in two operational configurations. In the EAnMBR, physicochemical, biological and electrokinetic processes interacted simultaneously permitting to control the effluent quality and sludge properties. The dark-color molasses-based wastewater containing the high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (53,000 mgL-1), total nitrogen (2,300 mgL-1), total phosphorus (150 mgL-1), was selected for this research and submitted to multi-phase studies. The research allowed to define optimal operational conditions leading to removal of carbon, nutrients by 99% and to complete discoloration in the EAnMBR system. The novel system was compared with anaerobic membrane bioreactor showing performance superiority of EAnMBR in respect to COD, sludge volume reduction and filterability by 10%, 54% and 7%, respectively. A separate experimental phase was dedicated to optimize the energy balance in the novel system by the surface response method. The EAnMBR demonstrated outstanding results which make it a promising advanced wastewater treatment technology for various applications, e.g. in food, agriculture and defence industries.

This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract Most of the Researchers  interest is focusing on Bridge Management System (BMS), by its Maintenance, Repair & Rehabilitation (MR&R) segments, while a good practice of bridge management should cover the conceptual design phase of a new bridge. Although conceptual design is one stage of a bridge life whereas there is still limited knowledge on how it should be conducted. Most often engineers  decisions are based on their past experience and standard solutions, which are affected by the subjectivity. This approach, most probably, does not reflect the effective way to address different problems of consistency in the decision. To design a new bridge, many factors, like the cost and aesthetic behavior, have to be considered due to their ability to affect the final decision. Generally, decision-makers will make their final design and decisions based on those factors in addition to human subjectivity. The objective of this research is to propose a methodology to develop systematic procedures that can help decision-makers select the most appropriate bridge type with its diverse components and to forecast its Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) and other characteristics such as the public satisfaction and environment sustainability of the selected bridge type. The proposed methodology integrates a decision support system with a relevant database within an artificial intelligence environment (AI) and bridge information management tools in order to reduce the impact of human subjectivity on the decision taken during the conceptual design stage of bridges life. For this purpose, Machine Learning technique, which is a part of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) environment, will be the core of the proposed methodology. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with its back-propagation algorithm is adopted in order to identify the appropriate solution by setting up its engine guidelines. A polynomial regression method will first be integrated in the DSS: 1) to formulate the database in order to establish the needed functions; 2) to define the input values for the ANN; and 3) to verify the intermediate ANN weightiness of the proposed methodology engine based on historic data retrieved from the database. An investigation will be conducted in order to define bridge characteristics and parameters, to be used in the ANN, and that affect the final decision. Elements of the ANN layers (Engine model) which include: Input, Hidden & output layers, have to be described based on a systematic and standardized process. The proposed methodology has the potential to be used in lower levels to determine other bridge components such as vertical structures, foundations and connection types. The objectives of the proposed methodology can be summarized as follow: Avoiding, as much as possible, the influence of human subjectivity on the decision-making process. Listing and Ranking all the other possible alternatives. Ensuring equivalent and fair consideration for all factors affecting the decision, and especially reducing the possibility to miss and overlook the impact of some factors that could be ignored while proceeding with making the right decision by using conventional decision-making approaches. Developing a model that can be considered as a guideline for further use that can be applied within any decision-making environment and based on a relevant historic database and experts  input.

To get things started, there s a guest, or sometimes two, who get the ball rolling by sharing their ideas, experiences and questions. After that, it's all up to the participants. As we attempt to understand the life cycle of a garment, how do we clothe ourselves more ethically? How can creative reuse help us to alleviate our ecological footprint? When thinking of a life cycle for garments,  cradle to cradle  is often the terminology used to describe garment conception from fibres to yarns and then from yarns to fabrics. Once fabrics are produced, garments or  end uses  are described.  End uses  can be developed to create beautiful fashion garments to everyday basic apparel. As a garment becomes mature and the product lifecycle expires, garments can be recycled back into fibres where the cycle is reborn and new concepts are developed.

Over course of the fall semester, students from Concordia University have returned to  the Point  for the third year to continue their community work in Pointe-Saint-Charles. The December 3rd event is open to the public and features exhibitions, research projects, and short performances. Schedule for the day 2pm-3pm: Performances at Share the Warmth (625 rue Fortune) 3pm-4pm: Curated walk through the neighbourhood 4pm-5pm: Vernissage at Salon Laurette (1950 rue du Centre) Events are free and all are welcome! Under the banner of The Right to the City, three classes are discovering how learning with the city, and across disciplines, can enrich education while giving back to the community at large. Students in Art History, Theatre, and Art Education return to study in and with  the Point , a traditionally working-class neighbourhood with a long history of community mobilization. Students have partnered with local organizations including the Atwater Library, the  Pointe-St-Charles YMCA ,  St-Columba House , and  Share the Warmth , among others. The project host is Share the Warmth/Partageons l espoir, a citizen-led resource founded on the principles of social economy, education as a right, food justice, and community self-determination. This unique platform for community-engaged learning allows Concordia s students to better understand real issues facing Montrealers. The Right to the City offers an educational opportunity that is unique to Concordia; in learning from one another and with the community, students develop their critical thinking processes alongside their collaboration skills and sense of how to be engaged citizens.  We are pleased and grateful to return to Pointe-Saint-Charles for the final year of this project and to have a group of students who have been true ambassadors for Concordia,  says Dr Cynthia Hammond, the project leader.  It has been a pleasure to deepen our partnerships with these vital organizations, and to reconnect with the neighbourhood. Our students  research and creative work help to show how learning can be reciprocal, a bridge between university and community.

This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract Since several decades ago, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted a great deal of attention in academic, industrial and military communities. Recently, multiple cooperative UAVs have been applied in various applications such as forest fire detection and fighting, search and exploration, environmental monitoring and surveillance. The main objectives of this dissertation are to design novel algorithms for single quadrotor UAV trajectory tracking control and multiple UAVs for cooperative/formation control. Then, applying these algorithms in forest monitoring and fire detection application, where a group of detection UAVs are required to surround and track the fire perimeter for monitoring and observation mission. Furthermore, new algorithm for fault-tolerant cooperative control (FTCC) is proposed, in order to mitigate potential UAVs fault effect for reliable and safe mission completion. Finally, a fire fighting algorithm is developed for achieving optimum distances for forest fire UAVs agents to arrive at their assigned fire spots destinations. A combination of sliding mode control (SMC) and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is used to design a single quadrotor UAV controller, which is then used to design a formation controller of multiple UAVs. Moreover, another formation controller is designed based on SMC to achieve robust formation control against modeling uncertainties and disturbances. Cooperative UAVs have been applied in forest monitoring and fire detection application through three stages: search, confirmation and observation. UAVs are assigned to search for potential forest fires in a certain area, once a fire is detected and a fire alarm will be generated. The UAVs team then reconfigures its formation by following a new elliptic fire perimeter, calculated by the ground station (GS) using a fire spread model. Afterwards, the confirmation stage begins and all UAVs start evenly distributed for surrounding the fire spot according to the UAVs number in the team. When the fire alarm is confirmed, the observation stage starts and UAVs continue tracking the fire along the fire perimeter. SMC is used to design a formation reconfigurable controller to switch between a predefined formation shape during the search stage, to a dynamic surrounding formation. This controller guarantees even distribution of UAVs surrounding the fire spots and the robustness against disturbances. In addition, task assignment is used with multiple fire spots and multiple UAVs teams in order to reduce the mission execution time. Moreover, the proposed control algorithms are implemented to a team of UAVs paired with a team of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), by using these UGVs as a take-off and landing platform in forest monitoring and fire detection application. Meanwhile, UAVs can need leave formation for refueling/recharging during the mission of search, confirmation and observation, or if a fault occurred during the mission due to fire flames, heat or UAV s internal fault sources. Therefore, an FTCC algorithm is designed based on the graph theory to mitigate the fault effect on mission completion, and ensure complete surrounding and data gathering of the fire spots using different fire sensors such as infrared cameras, charge-coupled devices (CCD) cameras and thermal cameras etc. Afterwards, data gathered during observation stage are implemented in the GS, then dangerous fire spots coordinates are sent to the fire fighting UAVs. The leader UAV, the GS, or both can perform the task assignment process using an auction-based or Hungarian algorithms, then each UAV is assigned a fire spot for deploying fire suppressant. Furthermore, a hybrid approach of control parametrization and time discretization (CPTD) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to achieve minimum flight distance for each UAV to arrive at its destination, minimizing fuel/battery consumption. Since PSO cannot solve the continuous control inputs, CPTD is used to provide an approximate piecewise linearization of the control inputs. Thus, PSO can be adopted to achieve the global optimum solution. Finally, the proposed algorithms are being implemented on single and multiple quadrotor UAVs in simulations. While, the leader-follower approach is used in cooperative control in a decentralized manner to avoid the disadvantages of centralization. Thereafter, the proposed algorithms are verified on a set of Qball-X4 quadrotor UAVs and QGV unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) platforms in real-time experiments through different scenarios.

Herein, we report the anionic polymerization of allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) on methoxy-PEG (mPEG) as macroinitiator to produce the diblock copolymer mPEG-b-PAGE. The mPEG-b-PAGE copolymer was then used as a common precursor to generate a systematic series of copolymers derivatized with pendant alkyl chains via thiolene click chemistry. These amphiphilic block copolymers were found to self-assemble in aqueous solution to form aggregates with distinct and unique morphologies. Depending on the hydrophobic weight fraction of the copolymer, spheres, long filomicelles, rods, disks and polymersomes with confirmed biocompatibility were formed. These materials were evaluated in terms of ability to solubilize the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). For each copolymer, stable micelle formulations were prepared that included high DOX to copolymer ratios of up to 20 % (wt%) with drug loading efficiencies > 60 % (w/w). In vitro drug release studies, conducted under physiologically relevant conditions, revealed sustained release profiles. Assessment of cytotoxicity in OVCAR8 human ovarian cancer cells grown in monolayers and spheroids confirmed that the activity of the formulated drug was conserved. The promising preliminary assessment of these alkylated copolymers encourages additional evaluation in vivo. Dr. Le D v dec carried out his undergraduate degree in biochemistry at UQAM. Under the supervision of Prof. M.A Mateescu, he completed his MSc in biochemistry in 2008 (with Honors). His work focused on the development of chromatographic devices for the separation of chitosan oligomers and the synthesis of polyalkylated chitosan for oral delivery. In 2008, he carried out his PhD, under the supervision of Prof. Julian Zhu at the University of Montreal, where he developed his skills in polymer chemistry and novel polymer drug delivery systems. After a brief time in the pharmaceutical industry, he moved to Ontario where he is currently carrying out his postdoctoral research in the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto, with Christine Allen. His research interests focus on the development and characterization of copolymers for sustained release of hydrophobic drugs from nano-scale delivery system to implantable devices, as well as the study of drug-polymer compatibility and the tunable morphology of drug carrier.

Rebecca Reuber, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto and Eileen Fischer, Schulich School of Business, York University Every new firm must find a means of creating value. Increasing numbers of them are doing so by enrolling unpaid outside actors in value co-creation. This paper inductively develops new theory about the consequences for new firms of relying on such value co-creation from inception. Through an in-depth, qualitative, study of Twitter, we theorize that co-creation intensity (the extent to which diverse external actors are empowered to co engage in value co-creation) increases the likelihood that an emerging firm will experience scope expansion (a proliferation of value propositions and infrastructure requirements). Co-creation intensity, together with scope expansion, in turn precipitates stakeholder ambivalence, which entails both stakeholder uncertainty about the category to which the new firm belongs and mixed reactions to engagement with it. These theoretical insights extend the literatures on opportunity creation by new ventures, and on value co-creation. They also offer practical insights for new firms endeavouring to establish viable business models.

Meet Stuart Marshall (1949-1993). In 1984, British video artist Stuart Marshall debuted two new works that boldly reacted to the homophobic response of international media to the AIDS crisis: the video installation, Journal of the Plague Year at Galerie Optica, Montreal as part of Video '84; and the now iconic hybrid documentary Bright Eyes, for the 11th Hour on Channel 4, Marshall's first for British television. London-based artist and programmer Conal McStravick s lecture will contextualise Marshall s significant and influential works on HIV/AIDS by drawing on the works themselves, archival TV appearances and documentation. McStravick will illustrate how Marshall's voice and his polemical stance on the representation of HIV/AIDS and AIDS activism resonated with international audiences and helped to propel debates about the pandemic in new directions. By applying both experimental video and existing televisual forms and conventions, Marshall addressed feminism, queer politics and AIDS activism in turn. A method that would define an influential, intersectional cultural/ critical programme that continues to influence contemporary research and practice today.  Meet Stuart Marshall  is accompanied by a panoply of World AIDS Week activities devoted to reviving the artist s work: two screening programs of his most important short works, plus a restoration of Journal of the Plague Year in conversation with selected video works by Concordia sexuality and film students entitled Generations at the VAV Gallery. Conal McStravick (b.1979, Lurgan, N.Ireland) makes solo and collaborative works to explore the histories, social practices, and economies of art and queer politics. In 2013, McStravick began researching Marshall and has since developed a series of active research events titled Learning in a Public Medium. This series explores Marshall's works, legacies and contemporary resonances as artist, activist, writer and educator through workshops, screenings and presentations. McStravick has appeared on panels at Glasgow Film Theatre, BFI London and Birkbeck Institute of the Moving Image to talk about queer film and video, Marshall and the Learning in a Public Medium project. In 2017, The Showroom, London are partnering with Conal McStravick & LUX to develop Learning in a Public Medium into a series of new dialogues with Marshall's works at venues across the UK.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract This qualitative study uses a grounded theory approach to examine work-family decision-making at the couple-level. It focuses on answering two questions: (1) How do couples develop and enact work-family routines and make non-routine decisions? And, (2) What is the role of identity construal in the way couples carry out their daily work-family responsibilities? By focusing on daily (or micro-role) experiences, I learned that daily work-family decisions are indeed made at the couple-level and that there are three types of daily work-family decisions, including decisions about work-family routines, decisions about immediate, unanticipated changes to routines and decisions about anticipated, scheduled events. Anchoring decisions made by couples over time create the context for decision-making for all three types of daily decisions. In terms of how couples make daily decisions at the work-family interface, I found that they consider multiple cues, including situational cues from their work and family contexts, activities cues, cues from their routines, cues from their relationships with one another, and cues related to family and parenting role expectations, but that the cues to which they attend and the processes for making sense of them varies by the type decision and the type of couple making the decision. Overall, my analysis of daily decisions revealed that these decisions are made in a manner consistent with a logic of appropriateness, which involves situational recognition and enactment of appropriate behavioral rules. These rules emanate from family role construals. Couples can be classified according to differences in their family role construals and each couple type uses different appropriateness rules, and thus tends to favour different choices for both anchoring and daily decisions. From a practical perspective, the results of this study have implications for couples looking for better strategies to meet their work and family responsibilities and for supervisors looking for better ways to support employees  efforts in carrying out their various roles. Theoretically, this research complements past work-family research, which has predominately focused on individual-level models and the negative aspects of combining personal roles with paid work. Also, it extends applications of identity theory in work-family science by broadening our understanding about the role of identity construals in work-family decisions.

Miceli Acts of terror are everywhere. Not one day goes by without hearing about the latest suicide bomb in Baghdad, knife stabbing in Germany, or shooting spree in France or in the United States. A Christian extremist preacher claims that homosexuals deserve to die because he considers their lifestyle to be sinful; groups like ISIS perpetrate genocide against religious minorities and call for global jihad against infidels; Buddhist monks in Myanmar persecute the Rohingya for fear that the Muslim minority destroy their country and religion. All these actions seem to be somehow religiously motivated, where the actors claim to act in accordance with their beliefs. In the midst of this spiral of violence seen across traditions and geographical locations, there is a pressing need to understand why people act as such in the name of their faith. The Global Impact of Religious Violence examines why individuals and groups sometimes commit irremediable atrocities, and offers some solutions on how to counter religiously inspired violence. \"The essays in this book explore the controversial thesis that religion itself leads to violence, rather than simply being used to justify the actions of angry activists. Though many will argue with this assumption, it contributes to the ongoing discussion about the role of religion in the violent encounters of contemporary public life.\" --Mark Juergensmeyer, author of Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence Andr  Gagn  is a tenured associate professor in the Dept. of Theological Studies at Concordia University (Montreal). His most recent co-edited volume is entitled 'Constructing Religious Identities during the Second Temple Period'. Spyridon Loumakis is a PhD candidate in Religion and part-time lecturer at Concordia University (Montreal). Calogero A. Miceli is a PhD candidate in Religion and part-time lecturer at Concordia University (Montreal) and Marianopolis College (Montreal).

English THE CROSSING tells the difficult story of individuals forced into displacement and takes us along on one of the most dangerous journeys of our time with a group of Syrians fleeing war and persecution, crossing a sea, two continents and five countries, searching for a home to rekindle the greatest thing they have lost - Hope. On a summer night, a group of Syrians wade quietly into the Mediterranean, with little children, a cat and little packets of food wrapped in cling-film held above their heads to climb into little boats that will take them to a fishing boat waiting in deeper waters. The little boat keels over from imbalanced loading. In the panic to save the children, they lose the cat and most of the food and water they have. A mother of 2 young children wants to return ashore, but it is too late, the police may have reached the beach and the only way available is into the sea. They are journalists, engineers, a musician and a psychologist climbing aboard an old unseaworthy fishing boat, manned by desperate smugglers who have never before sailed beyond coastal fishing waters. They make it to Europe, only to find out that the hardest part of their journey still lies ahead. Months of uncertainty and waiting, living in one centre after another, takes a toll on their spirits as they confront what being a  refugee  means. Where Room 110, Henry F.

The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge. Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public. Abstract Individuals differ in their chronotype, which ranges on a continuum from extreme morningness to extreme eveningness (Natale and Cicogna, 2002). Individuals exhibiting extreme morningness, also called larks, rise in the early hours of the morning and go to bed early at night, while those exhibiting extreme eveningness, also called owls, rise in the late hours of the morning and go to bed late at night (Horne and  sterberg, 1976, 1977). This thesis addresses a call from marketing scholars to better understand intra-day consumer behaviours and preferences, by investigating two time-related variables, chronotype and time-of-day, within the context of tourism. More specifically, it examines the influence of chronotype and time-of-day on travellers  behavioural intentions, overall satisfaction with a tourist destination and lifetime value for a tourist destination. It consists of two studies using a survey methodology. Study 1 focuses on 1982 consumers who travelled to the tourist destination under investigation at some point in the past, regardless of the year of their last trip. Study 2 focuses on 1483 consumers who travelled to the tourist destination under investigation within the past eight months. Results demonstrate that chronotype influences behavioural intentions and several indicators of customer lifetime value, and that time-of-day moderates the influence of chronotype on the likelihood of visiting the tourist destination.

The program's goal is to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists who not only conduct research and contribute to the scientific base of the discipline but who are also competent mental health professionals. Because research is such an important part of our program, students seeking only professional training or who do not intend to continue to the PhD degree should apply elsewhere. Overview Students with BA or BSc degrees begin their studies in the first year of the research and clinical training option, which includes course work in psychological theory and research design, clinical theory and practice, and a master's thesis. Students enroll in the MA in Psychology and the Diploma in Clinical Psychology. The MA portion of the research and clinical training option requires a minimum of one year of full time study, the Diploma an additional 8 months. Following successful completion of the master's thesis and courses, students continue doctoral studies, in which they receive advanced training in research methods, psychological theory, and clinical practice. Besides continuous involvement in research in one of the department's four areas of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, and Human Development and Developmental Processes) during their training, students also conduct a doctoral thesis, which must be a substantive piece of original research. The doctoral program requires a minimum of two years of full-time study. Following their doctoral thesis research, students complete a one-year, full-time internship in a clinic or hospital setting.  Our clinical psychology program has been accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association since 1986 and by the Ordre des psychologues du Qu bec since 2004. The Canadian Psychological Association requires disclosure of information on the applicant pool, acceptance rates, diversity, graduates, and other details about our programme.

This means that we strongly endorse the principle that a scientist-practitioner has a research orientation to his/her practice, and we encourage clinical relevance in research. Our model encompasses learning and career pathways individually tailored to student interest and faculty expertise. This permits a wide range of research emphases including those of basic research, while at the same time placing the highest value on the close integration of science and practice. The principal objective of our program is to produce graduates who have the necessary skills to function as researchers and as practitioners, who may function as either or both, and who meet the highest standards in the science and practice of psychology. Program goals & outcomes Our program adheres to the Accreditation Criteria and Principles of the Canadian and American Psychological Associations and the Ordre des psychologues du Qu bec in its specific goals for clinical training. The principal objective is that a graduate of our program be capable of functioning as an investigator and as a practitioner, and may function as either or both, consistent with the highest standards in psychology (Belar & Perry, 1992, p. 72). Our specific objectives include that our graduates: Be capable of conducting and publishing high quality psychological research in domains that have the potential to enhance the practice of psychology. Demonstrate knowledge of the theoretical and empirical roots in psychology of both clinical research and practice, and of current relevant developments in other areas of specialization in psychology. Demonstrate specialized knowledge of the major theoretical, methodological, and empirical work in clinical psychology, with both adults and children. Be capable of implementing theory-based, research-supported clinical practice, including assessment and treatment, with both adults and children. Demonstrate ethical and professional awareness and conduct in both their practice and their research. Be competent in dealing with individual and cultural diversity in values, beliefs and customs. Be capable of communicating knowledge to others. Be capable of consulting effectively with other professions, clients, and organizations. Be familiar with models of supervision, and competent in the supervision of other professionals. Functions for which students are prepared Students in our program receive the necessary academic, scientific, and clinical training so that they may contribute to psychological science and clinical practice in significant ways upon graduation. Our goal is to produce clinical psychologists who are highly trained in both the science of psychology and the methods of clinical practice, and who embody the roles of both researcher and clinical practitioner. Graduates of our program go on to careers in clinical and/or academic psychology in settings including hospitals, universities, health care clinics, and private practice.  Their activities are diverse and can include assessment, therapy, intervention, research, teaching, consultation, supervision and/or program planning in a wide variety of client populations.

The master's degree requires a minimum of one year of full-time study and involves - in addition to the thesis - course work in psychological theory and advanced statistics, seminars in the student's area of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, or Human Development and Developmental Processes), and directed teaching in our undergraduate program. The doctoral program involves similar advanced training: independent research; supervised reading, research and course work in subject matter and methods in the area of research specialization; program-wide research and methods seminars; and teaching experience. Doctoral studies require a minimum of two years of full-time study. Research Students are provided the resources to conduct research throughout their graduate education. All new students are accepted into our program by a faculty member who is willing to provide supervision and financial support. Thus, each student is associated with a research team comprised of faculty and graduate students. Research teams within the department are organized around four areas of research specialization (Behavioural Neuroscience, Clinical and Health Research, Cognitive Science, or Human Development and Developmental Processes) and pursue a variety of topics, including (but not limited to) appetitive motivation and drug dependence, problems in human development, cognitive and perceptual processes, and anxiety disorders. Because entering students have often had previous research experience and participate in advanced research in our program, students who complete the Ph.D. degree achieve a high level of research specialization and expertise. As a result of the high quality of our students' research, most students have opportunities to present their research findings at national and/or international scientific conferences.
